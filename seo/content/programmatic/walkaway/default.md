## What You'll Walk Away With

Our structured session produces concrete artifacts, not just conversation.

**Decision Snapshot**
A clear-eyed assessment of your current situation—what's true, what's not, and what actually matters for your decision.

**Fork Recommendation**
A specific direction (stay, go, or pivot) with the reasoning behind it, so you understand not just what to do but why.

**Risk Map**
Everything that could go wrong with your chosen path, and how to mitigate each risk before it materializes.

**Conversation Scripts**
Exact language for the hard conversations you need to have—with your boss, your partner, recruiters, or anyone else.

**14-Day Action Plan**
The specific steps to take immediately after our session, so momentum doesn't stall.

**30-Day Roadmap**
The longer-term plan for executing your decision, with milestones and check-in points.

These aren't templates—they're customized to your specific situation, role, and constraints.
