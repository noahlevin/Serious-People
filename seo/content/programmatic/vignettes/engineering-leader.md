## What This Looks Like in Practice

**The Scenario**: James, a Director of Engineering at a consumer tech company, was burning out. His team of 40 had grown without the corresponding support structure, and he was firefighting constantly. He loved the mission but dreaded Monday mornings.

**What He Did**: Before making any career moves, James separated the signal from the noise:

1. He mapped out which of his frustrations were fixable (team structure, processes) versus fundamental (company culture, leadership support)
2. He took a week of PTO to get some distance and perspective
3. He had a frank conversation with his VP about what would need to change for him to stay engaged

**The Outcome**: The conversation went better than expected. His VP hadn't realized how stretched James was and immediately approved two new manager hires. But the conversation also revealed a fundamental truth: the company's growth pace wasn't going to slow down. James would need to decide if he wanted to be on that ride.

He chose to stay, but with new boundaries and a clearer picture of what he was signing up for. A year later, he's still there—challenged but not drowning.

**The Lesson**: Sometimes the answer isn't leave or stay—it's renegotiate the terms of staying.
