## What This Looks Like in Practice

**The Scenario**: Sarah, a VP of Product at a Series D fintech company, had been struggling for months. The CEO kept changing priorities, her engineering counterpart was difficult to work with, and she hadn't shipped a major feature in two quarters. She wasn't sure if the problem was her, the company, or something else entirely.

**What She Did**: Instead of resigning in frustration or suffering in silence, Sarah got clarity on what was actually happening:

1. She documented the pattern of changing priorities—not to assign blame, but to understand if it was solvable
2. She had a direct conversation with her CEO about decision-making processes
3. She updated her network and had exploratory conversations, not to job hunt, but to calibrate her perspective

**The Outcome**: The conversations revealed that the CEO's behavior wasn't going to change—it was how he operated. Armed with this clarity, Sarah negotiated a transition timeline that worked for both parties. She landed at a company with a more structured leadership team within four months. Looking back, she wishes she'd started the clarity process six months earlier.

**The Lesson**: Clarity first, action second. Most people skip the diagnosis and jump straight to reactive moves.
