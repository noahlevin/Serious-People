## What This Looks Like in Practice

**The Scenario**: Patricia, VP of Operations at a logistics company, was offered a lateral move to lead a troubled division. It wasn't a promotion, but it was positioned as a "growth opportunity." She wasn't sure if it was a genuine chance to prove herself or a setup to fail.

**What She Did**: Before responding, Patricia did her due diligence:

1. She researched the division's history—why did the last leader leave, what were the known problems
2. She talked privately with executives who knew the real story
3. She negotiated specific conditions: budget, timeline to show results, and explicit success criteria

**The Outcome**: The research revealed a mixed picture. The division had real problems, but they were operational—Patricia's strength. Previous leaders had failed because they were product people, not operations experts.

She took the role, but only after securing a 12-month runway and written agreement on what success would look like. Eighteen months later, the division was profitable and Patricia had credibility across the organization that she'd never have gotten staying in her comfortable VP role.

**The Lesson**: "Growth opportunities" can be genuine or traps. The difference is whether you control the terms and have clear success criteria.
