## What This Looks Like in Practice

**The Scenario**: Marcus, a Director of Product at a mid-size SaaS company, was passed over for VP despite delivering strong results. His manager's feedback was vague: "You're not quite ready." He was torn between pushing harder, looking elsewhere, or accepting that maybe he wasn't VP material.

**What He Did**: Instead of spiraling, Marcus got specific:

1. He asked for concrete examples of what "VP-ready" looked like at his company
2. He talked to three people who had been promoted to VP recently—inside and outside his company
3. He assessed honestly whether the gap was real or political

**The Outcome**: The diagnosis revealed two things. First, his company had a pattern of promoting people who were highly visible to the CEO—which Marcus wasn't. Second, the specific feedback about "strategic thinking" was valid but actionable.

Marcus decided to address the skill gap while also broadening his external options. He found a VP role at a smaller company within six months, where his operational strengths were valued more than political visibility.

**The Lesson**: "You're not ready" is rarely the full story. Dig deeper to find out what's actually being said—and whether it's worth addressing there or somewhere else.
