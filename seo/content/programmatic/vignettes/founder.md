## What This Looks Like in Practice

**The Scenario**: Alex, a first-time founder who had built a company from zero to $5M ARR, was exhausted. The board wanted to bring in an experienced CEO to scale to the next level. Alex wasn't sure if this was a vote of no confidence or a natural evolution—and whether stepping aside meant failure.

**What He Did**: Instead of reacting emotionally, Alex created space for clarity:

1. He talked to three other founders who had gone through similar transitions
2. He worked with an executive coach to separate his identity from the company
3. He explored what role, if any, he wanted in the company's next chapter

**The Outcome**: The conversations revealed that bringing in a scaling CEO was common and often the right move—it wasn't about Alex's abilities, but about matching skills to stage. He negotiated a transition to Chief Product Officer, where he could focus on what he loved (building product) without the CEO responsibilities that drained him.

Two years later, the company hit $20M ARR. Alex was energized again, and glad he didn't let ego drive a reactive exit.

**The Lesson**: Founder transitions aren't failure—they're evolution. The question is whether you're in the driver's seat of that transition.
