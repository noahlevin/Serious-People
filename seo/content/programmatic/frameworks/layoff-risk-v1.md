## The Layoff Preparation Framework

If you sense layoffs coming, preparation is your best protection. Here's how to get ready.

**Read the Warning Signs**

Early indicators of organizational trouble:
- Hiring freezes, then attrition not being replaced
- Leadership changes without clear explanation
- Project cancellations or "strategic pivots"
- Financial metrics heading the wrong direction
- Unusual all-hands or communication patterns

**The Protection Playbook**

Start these immediately if you sense risk:

1. **Financial Buffer**: Build savings to cover 6-12 months of expenses

2. **Network Activation**: Reach out to contacts now, not when you're desperate

3. **Document Your Impact**: Collect metrics, outcomes, and recognition while you still have access

4. **Skill Refresh**: Identify gaps in your marketability and address them

**The Visibility Strategy**

In uncertain times, ensure decision-makers know your value:
- Volunteer for high-visibility projects
- Make your contributions measurable and known
- Build relationships across the organization, not just your team

**If It Happens**

Despite preparation, layoffs can still happen. If they do:
- Negotiate your severance (it's always negotiable)
- File for unemployment immediately
- Allow yourself to grieve, then activate your plan
