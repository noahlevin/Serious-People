## The Internal Pivot Framework

Changing roles within your company can be the best of both worlds—new challenge, familiar context. Here's how to do it right.

**Step 1: Honest Self-Assessment**

Before pursuing an internal move, answer honestly:
- Why do you want to leave your current role?
- Is it the role itself, or something else (manager, team, project)?
- What would make you stay if it were offered?

**Step 2: Map the Landscape**

Internal moves require political awareness:
- Who controls the roles you want?
- What's the informal process for internal transfers?
- Will your current manager support you or block you?

**Step 3: Build the Bridge**

Don't blindside your manager. The ideal sequence:
1. Express interest in growth privately with your manager first
2. Get their support (or at least neutrality)
3. Have exploratory conversations with target teams
4. Formalize the process through HR

**Step 4: Manage the Transition**

If you get the new role:
- Negotiate an appropriate transition timeline
- Document everything for your successor
- Leave your old team better than you found it

Your reputation for how you leave will follow you to your new role.
