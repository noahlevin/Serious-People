## The Stay-or-Go Framework

Before making any decision, separate the fixable from the fundamental. This framework helps you cut through the noise.

**Step 1: Name What's Actually Wrong**

Write down your top three frustrations. Be specific. "I hate my job" isn't useful. "My manager undermines my decisions in front of the team" is.

**Step 2: Test for Fixability**

For each frustration, ask:
- Has this changed in the last 12 months? (Direction matters)
- Is it within someone's power to fix it?
- Would fixing it require you to become someone you're not?

**Step 3: Calculate Your Real Runway**

Don't romanticize leaving. Know your numbers:
- Months of expenses covered by savings
- How long your job search will realistically take
- What you'd accept vs. what you're hoping for

**Step 4: Make the Call**

If the problem is fixable and you have the energy to fight for it, stay and fight. If it's fundamental or you're already depleted, start planning your exit. There's no shame in either choice—only in staying stuck.
