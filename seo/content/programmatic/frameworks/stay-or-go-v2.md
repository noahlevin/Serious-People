## The Decision Matrix Approach

When emotions run high, structure helps. Here's a systematic way to evaluate your stay-or-go decision.

**The Four Quadrants**

Map your situation across two dimensions: your energy level (depleted vs. sufficient) and the problem's fixability (structural vs. situational).

*High Energy + Situational Problem*: Stay and address it directly. You have the resources.

*High Energy + Structural Problem*: Consider a strategic exit. You can afford to be choosy.

*Low Energy + Situational Problem*: Dangerous zone. Fix the problem first, or you'll regret leaving.

*Low Energy + Structural Problem*: Exit, but protect yourself. Secure your landing before you leap.

**The Timeline Test**

Ask yourself: "If nothing changes, can I sustain this for 18 more months?" If the answer is no, you have your answer. If yes, you have time to be strategic.

**The Authenticity Check**

Are you staying because you're scared to leave, or because you genuinely believe things can improve? Be honest. Fear is not a strategy.
