## The Offer Evaluation Framework

An offer isn't just compensation—it's a bet on your next chapter. Evaluate it systematically.

**The Four Pillars**

Every offer should be evaluated across four dimensions:

1. **Economics**: Total compensation (base, bonus, equity), benefits, and future earning potential

2. **Growth**: Will this role expand your skills, relationships, and market value?

3. **Fit**: Does the culture, team, and working style match what you need?

4. **Risk**: What happens if this doesn't work out? How stable is the company?

**The Comparison Framework**

Don't evaluate an offer in isolation. Compare it to:
- Your current situation (including the cost of staying)
- Alternative offers you have or expect
- Your minimum requirements (what you won't compromise on)

**The Questions to Ask Before Signing**

- What does success look like in 12 months?
- What happened to the last person in this role?
- What's the biggest challenge I'll face in the first 90 days?
- How are decisions made that affect my work?

**The Negotiation Reality**

Everything is negotiable. Start date, base salary, signing bonus, equity, title, and scope are all on the table. But pick your battles—you can't win on everything.
