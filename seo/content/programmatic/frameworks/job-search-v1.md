## The Executive Job Search Framework

Senior job searches operate by different rules. Here's the framework that actually works at the executive level.

**The Hidden Market Reality**

At the executive level, 70%+ of roles are filled through relationships, not applications. Your job search strategy must reflect this:
- **Tier 1**: Direct outreach to your network
- **Tier 2**: Recruiters who specialize in your function and level
- **Tier 3**: Public postings (least effective, but still worth pursuing)

**The Positioning Question**

Before reaching out to anyone, clarify:
- What's your unique value proposition in one sentence?
- What problems do you solve that others can't?
- What size/stage of company is right for you?

**The Outreach Cadence**

Effective executive job search requires consistent activity:
- 5-10 meaningful conversations per week
- Regular check-ins with active recruiters
- Targeted applications where you have an inside connection

**The Timeline Reality**

Executive searches take longer—typically 4-9 months. Plan financially for this. The rush to take the first offer often leads to repeating the same problems in a new location.
