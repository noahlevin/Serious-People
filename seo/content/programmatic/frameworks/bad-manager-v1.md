## Managing Up When Your Manager Is the Problem

A difficult manager is one of the most common career challenges. Here's how to diagnose and navigate it.

**First: Categorize the Problem**

Bad managers fall into recognizable patterns:
- **The Micromanager**: Doesn't trust you, needs to approve everything
- **The Ghost**: Never available, provides no direction or support
- **The Credit-Taker**: Claims your work, blocks your visibility
- **The Bully**: Uses fear, publicly criticizes, plays favorites

Each requires a different response.

**Second: Document Everything**

Before taking action, start keeping records:
- Decisions made and their outcomes
- Commitments your manager makes (and breaks)
- Your contributions and their impact

This protects you and clarifies your thinking.

**Third: Attempt the Direct Approach**

Many bad managers don't know they're bad managers. One honest conversation might change things. Frame it as: "I want to do great work here. Can we talk about how to make that easier?"

**Fourth: Build Alternatives**

If direct approaches fail, your options are:
- Find a new role internally (bypass the manager)
- Wait out your manager (they might leave first)
- Leave the organization entirely

Don't wait indefinitely. Set a timeline.
