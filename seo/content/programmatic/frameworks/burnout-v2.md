## The Burnout Recovery Framework

Burnout isn't laziness or weakness—it's a signal that something in the system is broken. Here's how to address it methodically.

**Stage 1: Stabilize**

Before making any decisions, reduce your load. Not forever, but for now.
- Identify one commitment you can drop or delegate this week
- Protect one evening per week as non-negotiable personal time
- Set one hard boundary (no emails after 8pm, no weekend work)

**Stage 2: Investigate**

Once stable, examine the root causes:
- Is it volume (too much work)?
- Is it intensity (constant high-stakes)?
- Is it control (being directed, not directing)?
- Is it recognition (invisible effort)?

**Stage 3: Negotiate or Navigate**

If the root cause is fixable within your organization, have the conversation. If it requires a fundamental change in how the company operates, accept that and plan accordingly.

**Stage 4: Rebuild or Redirect**

Recovery isn't returning to the old normal. It's building a new baseline that's sustainable. This might mean the same role with new boundaries, or an entirely new chapter.
