## The Clean Exit Framework

How you leave matters as much as where you go. Here's how to resign without burning bridges.

**Before You Announce**

Prepare these before saying anything:
- Written resignation letter (brief, professional, positive)
- Transition plan outline (what you'll hand off, to whom, timeline)
- List of key relationships you want to preserve

**The Conversation**

Tell your manager first, always. The structure:
1. State your decision clearly (don't leave room for ambiguity)
2. Express gratitude genuinely
3. Present your proposed transition timeline
4. Ask what would make this transition easier for them

**The Transition Period**

Use your notice period well:
- Document everything that lives only in your head
- Introduce your replacement to key stakeholders
- Complete or hand off outstanding projects
- Collect any materials you'll need (performance reviews, work samples)

**The Counteroffer**

If one comes, remember: the reasons you decided to leave are still there. Counteroffers rarely address the root cause. Accept only if something fundamental has changed—not just money.

**The Exit Interview**

Be honest but diplomatic. This is not the time for settling scores. Focus on systemic feedback, not personal grievances.
