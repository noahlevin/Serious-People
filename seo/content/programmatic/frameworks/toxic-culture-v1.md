## Recognizing and Responding to Toxic Culture

Toxic culture is harder to address than a bad manager because it's systemic. Here's how to assess your situation.

**The Culture Red Flags**

Trust your instincts if you see:
- Blame flows down, credit flows up
- People are afraid to speak honestly
- High performers leave, politicians stay
- Rules apply differently to different people
- "That's just how things work here" is a common refrain

**The Individual vs. Systemic Test**

Can you point to specific individuals causing the toxicity, or is it everywhere? If it's specific people, you might outlast them. If it's systemic, the culture won't change until leadership changes.

**Your Three Options**

1. **Adapt and Survive**: Build a protective bubble. Keep your head down, do good work, maintain your network outside the company. This is sustainable short-term.

2. **Fight from Within**: Only if you have significant political capital and allies. Most internal reformers burn out or get pushed out.

3. **Strategic Exit**: The most common right answer. But do it on your terms, not in a moment of frustration.

**The Health Check**

If you're having physical symptoms (sleep problems, anxiety, dread), your timeline just shortened. No job is worth your health.
