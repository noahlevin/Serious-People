## The Severance Negotiation Framework

Whether you're being pushed out or negotiating an exit, here's how to approach severance strategically.

**Know Your Leverage**

Your negotiating power depends on:
- What you know (sensitive information, key relationships)
- What you can do (walk away gracefully vs. make noise)
- What they need (clean transition, no legal risk)
- What's standard (precedent matters)

**The Standard Components**

A severance package typically includes:
- **Cash**: Weeks of pay per year of service (2-4 weeks is common, executives may get more)
- **Benefits**: COBRA coverage or continuation
- **Equity**: Accelerated vesting or extended exercise windows
- **Outplacement**: Job search support (often negotiable upward)
- **References**: Agreed-upon language and contacts

**What to Negotiate**

Everything is negotiable, but focus on:
1. Cash amount (the most flexible component)
2. Equity treatment (often overlooked, can be significant)
3. Release timing (don't sign immediately—you have 21 days by law if over 40)

**The Signature Question**

Before signing anything, ask: "Is this the best I can do, or am I leaving something on the table because I'm tired of fighting?" Get help if you're unsure.
