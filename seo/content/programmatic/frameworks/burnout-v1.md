## Diagnosing Burnout vs. Bad Fit

Burnout and bad fit feel similar but require opposite responses. Here's how to tell the difference.

**The Vacation Test**

After two weeks away from work, how do you feel?
- If you dread returning: Could be either burnout or bad fit
- If you feel recharged but anxious: More likely burnout
- If you feel nothing—no dread, no excitement: Likely bad fit

**The Role Swap Thought Experiment**

Imagine doing your exact job at a different company, with a different team. Does the thought excite you or exhaust you?
- Excited: You're burned out from the environment, not the work
- Exhausted: The role itself may be wrong for you

**The Three Pillars Check**

Sustainable work requires three things: autonomy, competence, and connection. Score each 1-10 in your current role.
- All below 5: Structural problem—likely need to leave
- One below 5: Targeted fix possible
- All above 7 but still exhausted: Classic burnout—needs recovery, not escape

**Recovery vs. Exit**

Burnout requires rest before making major decisions. Bad fit requires clarity, not rest. Don't confuse the two.
