## Common Mistakes Founders Make at Career Crossroads

Founders face unique career challenges—especially when deciding whether to stay, transition, or move on.

**Mistake 1: Identity Fusion**

When you've built something from nothing, it's hard to separate yourself from the company. But "I am the company" is dangerous thinking. It leads to staying too long, making reactive decisions, and personal crisis when the company changes.

**Mistake 2: Not Planning for the Transition**

Whether you're moving to a different role, bringing in new leadership, or exiting entirely, founders often fail to plan the transition. This hurts both you and the company.

**Mistake 3: Underestimating Your Transferable Value**

Founders often think they're only qualified to found companies. In reality, you have rare skills: building from zero, resource-constrained execution, team building, stakeholder management. These translate to many contexts.

**Mistake 4: Making Decisions Based on Sunk Cost**

"I've put too much in to leave now" is the sunk cost fallacy. The question isn't what you've invested—it's what the path forward offers. Sometimes the best thing for you and the company is to step aside.

**Mistake 5: Neglecting Financial Planning**

Founders often sacrifice personal financial security for the company. This limits your options when it's time to make a change. Build a financial buffer that gives you real choices.
