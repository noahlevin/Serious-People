## Common Mistakes Operations Leaders Make

Operations leaders keep businesses running. But that essential role comes with career risks.

**Mistake 1: Being Invisible Because Everything Works**

Good operations is invisible—things just work. This is great for the business but terrible for your career. You must actively surface your impact, or you'll be overlooked for recognition and advancement.

**Mistake 2: Becoming the Indispensable Bottleneck**

Being the only person who knows how something works feels like job security. It's actually a trap. You become impossible to promote and exhausting to rely on.

**Mistake 3: Reactive Career Management**

Operations roles demand constant firefighting. This makes it easy to neglect your own career development. Scheduling time for networking, skill-building, and strategic thinking must be intentional.

**Mistake 4: Undervaluing Transformation Experience**

Steady-state operations is valuable, but transformation experience is what gets you to the next level. Seek out change projects, turnarounds, and scaling challenges—even when they're uncomfortable.

**Mistake 5: Staying in the Wrong Size Company**

Operations roles vary dramatically by company stage. A Series B ops leader is a different job than a Fortune 500 ops leader. Know which environment suits your skills and preferences.
