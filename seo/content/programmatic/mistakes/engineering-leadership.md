## Common Mistakes Engineering Leaders Make

Engineering leadership comes with specific career pitfalls. Here's what to watch for.

**Mistake 1: Staying Technical Too Long**

The transition from IC to manager is only the first step. Engineering leaders who cling to technical work as their primary value often struggle to advance. Your value shifts to judgment, team building, and organizational effectiveness.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Politics**

"I just want to write code and build things" doesn't work at the leadership level. Understanding organizational dynamics, building alliances, and managing up are required skills. Pretending otherwise limits your impact.

**Mistake 3: Tolerating Dysfunction Because You're "Used to It"**

Engineers are problem-solvers. Sometimes that means normalizing dysfunction because "we'll figure it out." This leads to staying too long in roles that aren't serving you.

**Mistake 4: Defining Yourself by Your Stack**

Technology changes faster than careers. Leaders who identify too closely with specific technologies become stuck. Your value is your judgment, not your current toolset.

**Mistake 5: Neglecting the Business Side**

Engineering leaders who can connect technical decisions to business outcomes are rare and valuable. Those who can't are seen as cost centers. Learn the language of revenue, margin, and strategic priority.
