## Common Mistakes Product Leaders Make

Product leaders face unique career challenges. Here are the patterns that derail even strong performers.

**Mistake 1: Confusing Product Success with Career Success**

Building a great product doesn't automatically build a great career. You also need:
- Visibility with executives beyond your immediate chain
- A narrative about your unique contribution
- Relationships that survive role changes

**Mistake 2: Waiting Too Long to Leave a Sinking Ship**

Product leaders are naturally optimistic—that's part of the job. But this optimism can blind you to organizational dysfunction. If you've been promised resources/support three times and it hasn't materialized, it won't.

**Mistake 3: Undervaluing Business Metrics**

Technical product skills are table stakes. The product leaders who advance tie their work to revenue, retention, and strategic impact. If you can't tell that story, you're invisible to the people who make decisions.

**Mistake 4: Burning Out Quietly**

Product roles have unlimited scope and limited control. This is a recipe for burnout. The most common mistake is suffering in silence until you're depleted, then making a reactive career move.

**Mistake 5: Not Building Externally**

Your network, thought leadership, and external reputation are career insurance. Product leaders who focus only internally become trapped in their current company's orbit.
