### Signs It's Affecting Your Health

Watch for these warning signals:

- Sleep problems (trouble falling asleep, waking up anxious)
- Physical symptoms (headaches, stomach issues, tension)
- Anxiety about work when not working
- Depression or hopelessness
- Impact on relationships outside work
- Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
