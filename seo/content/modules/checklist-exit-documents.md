### Documents to Collect Before You Leave

Secure these while you still have access:

- [ ] Performance reviews (all available years)
- [ ] Key emails documenting your accomplishments
- [ ] Metrics and results you influenced (screenshots, exports)
- [ ] Contact information for colleagues (personal emails, not work)
- [ ] Any awards, recognition, or commendations
- [ ] Work samples you can legally keep (check your agreements)
- [ ] Project documentation that shows your contributions

**Don't take:** Proprietary information, trade secrets, customer data, or anything covered by NDA. But documenting your accomplishments with numbers is fair game.
