### The Decision Matrix

Create a simple scoring system. Rate each factor 1-10 and weight by importance:

| Factor | Score (1-10) | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Factor A | — | 25% | — |
| Factor B | — | 25% | — |
| Factor C | — | 20% | — |
| Factor D | — | 15% | — |
| Factor E | — | 15% | — |
| **Total** | | | **—** |

This forces systematic thinking instead of emotional decision-making. Use it to compare options side by side.
