### The Counteroffer Trap

About half of people who accept counteroffers leave within 18 months anyway. Here's why:

1. **The underlying problems don't change.** You wanted to leave for reasons beyond money.
2. **Trust is damaged.** Your manager knows you were looking.
3. **You become a flight risk.** When layoffs come, you're on the list.
4. **It's often a delay tactic.** The company needs time to replace you.

If they could have given you more money or better conditions—why did it take your resignation to make it happen?
