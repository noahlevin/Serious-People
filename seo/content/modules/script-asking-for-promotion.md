### The Promotion Ask Script

**Set up the meeting:**
> "I'd like to schedule time to talk about my role and where I see it going. Can we find 30-45 minutes in the next couple of weeks?"

**Open with context:**
> "I really appreciate the opportunities I've had here, and I've loved working on [specific thing]. I want to talk about where I see my role going and how I can continue to grow."

**Make the ask:**
> "I'd like to be considered for promotion to [title]. I've been in this role for [X years] and consistently exceeded expectations in [specific areas]. I've already taken on [examples of expanded scope], and I think making it official would reflect the work I'm doing."

**If they say you're not ready:**
> "I'd love to understand what readiness would look like. What would I need to demonstrate?"

**Close with next steps:**
> "Thanks for hearing me out. What's the best next step? Should we schedule a follow-up in [timeframe]?"
