### Calculate Your Financial Runway

Before making any move, understand your numbers:

**What to calculate:**
- [ ] Total liquid savings
- [ ] Monthly essential expenses (rent, food, insurance, debt)
- [ ] Monthly discretionary expenses (what can you cut?)
- [ ] Severance amount and timing (if applicable)
- [ ] Unemployment benefits (if eligible)
- [ ] Any other income sources

**The formula:**
```
Runway = (Savings + Severance) ÷ Monthly Expenses
```

**Target:** 3 months minimum, 6 months ideal. If you're short, reduce discretionary spending now.
