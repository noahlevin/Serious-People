### The Resignation Script

Keep it short, clear, and professional:

> "I wanted to let you know that I've decided to move on. My last day will be [date, typically 2 weeks out]. I'm grateful for the opportunity here, and I want to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible."

**If they ask why:**
> "I was approached with an opportunity that's a great fit for my career goals right now."

**If they make a counteroffer:**
> "I appreciate that, and it means a lot. But I've made my decision. I'd rather focus on making sure the transition goes well."

**If they react badly:**
> "I understand this is difficult timing. I want to help make this as smooth as possible."

Stay calm. Don't match negative energy. Repeat your transition focus.
