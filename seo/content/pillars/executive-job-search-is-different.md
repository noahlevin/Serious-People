## Why It's Different

If you're a VP, Director, or C-level executive looking for your next role, you're playing a different game than you did earlier in your career. Here's what's changed:

**The hidden market is bigger.** At senior levels, most roles never get posted publicly. They're filled through networks, search firms, and internal promotions. If you're only applying to job postings, you're seeing maybe 30% of the opportunities.

**The timeline is longer.** Entry-level roles can close in weeks. Executive searches take 3-6 months or more. There are more stakeholders, more interviews, more deliberation.

**Relationships matter more.** Your resume gets you in the door at junior levels. At senior levels, relationships get you in the door. The resume closes the deal.

**Fit is evaluated differently.** Companies aren't just looking for skills. They're looking for leadership style, cultural fit, strategic thinking, and presence. These are harder to assess and take longer to evaluate.

**Compensation is more complex.** Base salary, bonus, equity, sign-on bonuses, benefits, severance—there are more variables, more negotiation, and more room for creative structuring.

## The Executive Search Playbook

### 1. Define Your Target Before You Start

Don't spray and pray. At the executive level, you need a clear thesis about what you want and why you're right for it.

**Get specific on:**
- Industry: Where do you want to be? Where will your experience translate?
- Company stage: Startup? Growth? Enterprise? Turnaround?
- Scope: Build from scratch? Optimize? Scale? Fix?
- Role: What title and responsibilities are you targeting?
- Geography: Remote? Hybrid? Relocation possible?

The clearer you are, the easier it is for people to help you. "I'm looking for VP Product roles at Series B-C enterprise software companies in the Bay Area" is referrable. "I'm open to anything" is not.

### 2. Lead with Relationships, Not Applications

At senior levels, your network is your job board.

**The priority order:**
1. **First-degree connections** — People who know your work and can refer you directly
2. **Second-degree connections** — Intros through your first-degree network
3. **Executive recruiters** — Search firms working on relevant roles
4. **Inbound applications** — Job postings (lowest hit rate at this level)

**How to activate your network:**
- Make a list of 50 people who could help (former colleagues, bosses, peers, board members)
- Reach out personally (not a mass email)
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Ask for introductions, not jobs

**The script:**
"I'm exploring my next move and would love to catch up. I'm focused on [specific target]. If you know anyone who might be interesting to talk to, I'd really appreciate an introduction."

### 3. Get Positioned with Executive Recruiters

Search firms matter more at senior levels. Many companies hire exclusively through retained search for VP+ roles.

**How recruiters work:**
- They're hired by companies to fill specific roles
- They get paid when they place someone
- They work for the company, not for you
- But they need good candidates, so building relationships helps

**How to get on their radar:**
- Identify firms that specialize in your function and industry
- Connect on LinkedIn with partners and principals
- Have a clear, concise positioning statement
- Be responsive and professional
- Be a source of referrals (even if you're not right for a role, recommend others)

**Reality check:** Recruiters are useful, but they're not your job search strategy. They're one channel among several.

### 4. Craft Your Positioning

At senior levels, you need a clear narrative about who you are and what you do.

**The components:**
- **Your superpower** — What are you distinctively good at?
- **Your trajectory** — What's the through-line in your career?
- **Your proof points** — What results can you point to?
- **Your thesis** — What do you believe about your function/industry that others don't?

**The format:**
"I'm a [role] who specializes in [specific thing]. I've spent my career [trajectory]. At [company], I [specific accomplishment]. I'm now looking for [specific next thing] because [reason]."

Example: "I'm a VP of Engineering who specializes in scaling teams through hyper-growth. I've spent my career at companies that grew from 50 to 500+ engineers. At [Company], I built the platform team from scratch and reduced deployment time by 80%. I'm looking for another scale-up that's hitting that 50-to-500 inflection point."

### 5. Prepare for a Different Interview Process

Executive interviews are less about technical skills and more about leadership, fit, and thinking.

**What you'll face:**
- Multiple rounds with senior stakeholders
- Board member or investor interviews
- Case studies or strategic presentations
- Reference checks (real ones, not just the ones you provide)
- Sometimes, a "trial project" or consulting engagement before an offer

**How to prepare:**
- Have stories ready for leadership situations (conflict, failure, building teams, making hard calls)
- Research the company deeply (product, competitors, challenges, culture)
- Prepare thoughtful questions (show you understand their problems)
- Practice talking about your failures (they will ask)
- Know your numbers (revenue, headcount, metrics you influenced)

### 6. Accept the Timeline

Executive job searches typically take 3-6 months. Sometimes longer.

**Why it takes so long:**
- Fewer roles at this level
- Longer interview processes
- More stakeholders involved in decisions
- Companies take longer to make senior hires
- Timing has to align (budget, org changes, etc.)

**How to manage it:**
- Start before you need to (3-6 months before you want to start)
- Have financial runway (don't accept a bad offer out of desperation)
- Stay active (keep taking meetings even when things are "in process")
- Don't count on any single opportunity (have multiple conversations going)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Leading with Your Resume
At senior levels, your resume is table stakes. It gets you in the door after you've already been referred. Don't lead with it—lead with relationships and a clear positioning.

### Mistake 2: Being Too Open
"I'm open to anything" doesn't help people help you. Be specific about what you want, even if you're actually flexible. You can always expand your criteria later.

### Mistake 3: Underinvesting in LinkedIn
At senior levels, your LinkedIn profile is often your first impression. Make sure it's current, well-written, and tells a clear story. Many recruiters search LinkedIn before anywhere else.

### Mistake 4: Waiting Until You're Desperate
The worst time to look for a job is when you urgently need one. Start early, stay networked, and always have a few conversations going—even when you're happily employed.

### Mistake 5: Not Asking for Help
Senior people often feel they should be able to find their next role on their own. But this is a team sport. The best leaders get help—from coaches, from networks, from advisors.

## What You'll Walk Away With

When you approach your executive job search strategically, you get:

- **A clear target** — Specific criteria for your next role
- **A positioning statement** — A concise narrative about who you are and what you offer
- **A networking plan** — Who to reach out to and how
- **Interview preparation** — Stories, questions, and presentation skills
- **Realistic expectations** — A timeline and approach that works at your level

The goal isn't to find any job. It's to find the right job—and to do it in a way that sets you up for success.
