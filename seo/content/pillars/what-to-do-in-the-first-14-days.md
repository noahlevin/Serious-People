## Why the First 14 Days Matter

The period right after leaving a job is emotionally charged. You might feel relieved, anxious, excited, scared, or all of the above. It's tempting to either frantically job search or completely check out.

Both are mistakes.

The first two weeks are about transitioning well: securing what you need, setting up systems, and building momentum—without burning out before you've even started.

## The 14-Day Plan

### Days 1-2: Handle the Logistics

Before you do anything else, take care of the administrative essentials.

**Day 1:**
- [ ] Take a deep breath. You made it.
- [ ] Review your severance documents (if applicable)
- [ ] Secure any company property you need to return
- [ ] Download/transfer important contacts from your work email (before you lose access)
- [ ] Save copies of performance reviews, awards, metrics you influenced
- [ ] Update your password manager (remove work accounts)
- [ ] Set up personal email forwarding if possible

**Day 2:**
- [ ] Review your benefits situation (health insurance, retirement accounts)
- [ ] Understand your COBRA options and timeline
- [ ] Check your final paycheck calculation
- [ ] File for unemployment if eligible (no shame in this)
- [ ] Update your mailing address if needed for documents
- [ ] Cancel any subscriptions tied to your work

### Days 3-4: Create Your Financial Picture

Now that the immediate logistics are handled, understand your runway.

**What to calculate:**
- Total liquid savings
- Monthly essential expenses (rent, food, insurance, debt payments)
- Monthly discretionary expenses (what can you cut if needed?)
- Severance payment amount and timing
- Unemployment benefits (if applicable)
- Any other income sources

**The math:**
Total runway = (Savings + Severance) / Monthly expenses

**Target:** You want at least 3 months of runway, ideally 6. If you're short, consider temporary cost cuts or income sources.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Create a simple budget for the job search period
- [ ] Move money if needed (separate job search fund)
- [ ] Reduce discretionary spending if runway is short
- [ ] Talk to your partner about finances (if applicable)

### Days 5-6: Process and Reflect

You've handled the practical stuff. Now take a breath and reflect before jumping into job search mode.

**Questions to sit with:**
- What was really going on at my last job?
- What do I want to repeat in my next role?
- What do I want to avoid?
- If I had no constraints, what would I do?
- What am I afraid of?
- What am I excited about?

**Activities:**
- [ ] Journal or talk through your experience
- [ ] Reconnect with someone who knows you well (outside work)
- [ ] Do something that brings you joy (you're allowed)
- [ ] Get some exercise, sleep, and decent food

This isn't wasted time. Clarity now saves months of chasing the wrong opportunities later.

### Days 7-8: Define Your Target

Now you're ready to think about what's next. But before you apply to anything, get clear on what you're looking for.

**The specifics:**
- What role title(s) are you targeting?
- What industries or company stages interest you?
- What kind of work do you want to be doing day-to-day?
- What's your must-have vs. nice-to-have list?
- What are your geographic constraints?
- What's your compensation floor?

**Create:**
- [ ] A one-paragraph positioning statement (who you are, what you're great at)
- [ ] A list of 10-20 target companies
- [ ] A list of 50 people in your network who could help
- [ ] Your updated resume and LinkedIn

### Days 9-10: Update Your Materials

Your resume, LinkedIn, and positioning need to be ready before you start reaching out.

**Resume updates:**
- [ ] Refresh with most recent role and accomplishments
- [ ] Quantify achievements where possible
- [ ] Tailor summary to your target role
- [ ] Check for typos (get someone else to proofread)
- [ ] Have both PDF and editable versions

**LinkedIn updates:**
- [ ] Professional headshot
- [ ] Headline that reflects your target (not "Seeking opportunities")
- [ ] About section that tells your story
- [ ] Accomplishments highlighted in experience section
- [ ] Skills section updated
- [ ] Recommendations (ask for new ones if needed)

**Your positioning:**
- [ ] A clear answer to "What are you looking for?"
- [ ] A clear answer to "Why did you leave?"
- [ ] Stories for key interview questions ready

### Days 11-12: Activate Your Network

Networking before applications. This is especially true for senior roles where the hidden job market is significant.

**Who to reach out to:**
- Former managers who liked you
- Former colleagues at senior levels
- People at your target companies
- Recruiters in your space
- Mentors and advisors

**The message:**
"I'm exploring my next move and wanted to reach out. I'm looking for [specific target]. Would love to catch up and hear what you're seeing in the market. And if you know anyone I should talk to, I'd really appreciate introductions."

**Goals:**
- [ ] Reach out to 10-15 people in your network
- [ ] Schedule 3-5 conversations for the following week
- [ ] Identify 2-3 recruiters to connect with
- [ ] Join relevant professional communities or groups

### Days 13-14: Build Your System

You need a sustainable system for the job search ahead. Set it up now, before you're in the thick of applications.

**Create:**
- [ ] A tracking spreadsheet (applications, conversations, follow-ups)
- [ ] A daily schedule (blocks for networking, applications, interview prep)
- [ ] A workspace (home office, co-working space, library)
- [ ] Email folders for job search correspondence
- [ ] Calendar reminders for follow-ups

**Establish routines:**
- [ ] Morning routine (get up, get dressed, start at a set time)
- [ ] Work blocks (treat job searching like a job)
- [ ] Breaks and exercise (burnout is real even without a job)
- [ ] End-of-day routine (stop working at a reasonable hour)

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Panic-Apply
Sending 100 applications in week one won't help. Quality over quantity. Targeted outreach beats spray and pray.

### Don't Disappear
It's tempting to hide until you have a new job. But your network is more helpful when you're looking than when you've already found something.

### Don't Compare Yourself to Others
Everyone's timeline is different. Someone who found a job in two weeks isn't better than someone who took three months.

### Don't Overwork
Job searching is stressful. If you work 12-hour days on it, you'll burn out. Pace yourself—this might take a while.

### Don't Make Major Decisions
Right after leaving a job is not the time to move cities, end relationships, or make other big life changes. Let the dust settle.

## What You'll Walk Away With

After following this 14-day plan, you'll have:

- **Logistics handled** — Benefits, finances, documents secured
- **Clarity** on what you want in your next role
- **Updated materials** — Resume, LinkedIn, positioning ready
- **Network activated** — Conversations scheduled, people aware you're looking
- **A sustainable system** for the job search ahead
- **Momentum** — Without the burnout

The goal isn't to have a job offer in 14 days. It's to be fully set up and positioned for a successful search, however long it takes.
