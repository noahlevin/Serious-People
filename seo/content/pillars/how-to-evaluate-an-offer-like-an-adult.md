## The Real Cost of a Bad Decision

Taking the wrong job isn't just a setback—it's a compound loss. You lose time (6-18 months before you can reasonably leave), opportunity (the roles you passed up), momentum (the gap in progression), and often, confidence.

And yet most people make this decision based on a gut feeling after a few hours of interviews. They focus on the offer letter and forget to evaluate everything else.

Let's do this properly.

## The Evaluation Framework

Every job offer should be evaluated across five dimensions:

1. **The Role** — What will you actually be doing?
2. **The Manager** — Who will you be working for?
3. **The Compensation** — What's the total package worth?
4. **The Trajectory** — Where does this lead?
5. **The Company** — Is this the right environment?

Most people over-index on #3 and under-index on everything else. Let's go through each.

## 1. Evaluating the Role

The title is what they put on the offer letter. The role is what you'll actually do every day.

**Questions to answer:**
- What does a typical week look like in this role?
- What are the key objectives for the first 6-12 months?
- What decisions will you own? What will require approval?
- Who will you work with most closely?
- What resources (budget, headcount, tools) will you have?
- Is this role set up for success, or is it a cleanup job?

**Red flags:**
- Vague descriptions that keep shifting
- The previous person left quickly or under unclear circumstances
- The scope is too broad or too narrow for one person
- The role has been open for a long time without being filled

**The test:** Can you describe what success looks like in 6 months? If not, the role isn't well-defined.

## 2. Evaluating the Manager

Your manager has more impact on your daily experience and career trajectory than almost anything else. A great role with a bad manager is miserable. A mediocre role with a great manager can be transformative.

**Questions to answer:**
- What's their leadership style?
- How do they give feedback?
- What happened to their previous direct reports? (Were they promoted? Did they leave?)
- How long have they been in this role?
- What do people who've worked for them say?

**How to find out:**
- Ask directly in the interview: "How would you describe your management style?"
- Ask for backchannel references: Find people who've worked for this person and ask off the record
- Look at LinkedIn: Where did their former reports go? Are they still connected?
- Watch for signals: How do they treat you during the interview process?

**Red flags:**
- High turnover on their team
- They can't articulate their management approach
- They speak poorly of their team or past employees
- The interview process feels chaotic or disorganized (they run things)

**The test:** Would you trust this person to have your back when things get hard?

## 3. Evaluating Compensation

Most people only look at base salary. That's a mistake. Total compensation includes multiple components, each with different characteristics.

**Components to consider:**

| Component | Considerations |
|-----------|---------------|
| Base salary | Stable, taxable, what you can count on |
| Bonus | Variable, often tied to company and individual performance |
| Equity | Illiquid, risky, potentially high upside (or worthless) |
| Sign-on bonus | One-time, often has clawback provisions |
| Benefits | Health, retirement matching, PTO, parental leave |
| Perks | Flexibility, WFH policy, learning budgets |

**Equity reality check:**
- Pre-IPO equity is worth $0 until there's a liquidity event
- What's the company's realistic path to liquidity?
- What's your strike price and what's the current 409A valuation?
- How much has the company raised and at what valuation?
- What's your percentage ownership (not just share count)?

**The formula:**
Total annual compensation = Base + (Expected bonus × probability of hitting it) + (Equity annual vesting × probability of liquidity × expected value)

**Be honest about risk.** If the equity is unlikely to be worth much, don't weight it heavily in your decision.

## 4. Evaluating Trajectory

This job isn't just about this job. It's about where it leads.

**Questions to answer:**
- What role does this set you up for in 2-3 years?
- Will you learn new skills or stagnate?
- Will you build valuable relationships?
- Will this company name help you? (Brand matters for some roles)
- Is there room to grow inside this company?
- Is this a stepping stone or a destination?

**The trade-off:** Sometimes you take a role that's lower compensation or prestige because it positions you for something bigger. That can be smart. But be clear-eyed about whether the trajectory is real or just theoretical.

**Red flags:**
- You'll be doing exactly what you're already doing
- The company has no history of promoting from within
- The skills you'll use are becoming less valuable in the market
- It's a lateral move disguised as a promotion

## 5. Evaluating the Company

Culture, stability, and trajectory all matter. The right role at the wrong company is still the wrong job.

**Questions to answer:**
- Is the company growing, stable, or declining?
- What's the financial health? (runway for startups, profitability for established)
- What's the culture like? (Ask multiple people, not just your interviewer)
- How does this company treat employees in hard times?
- What's the reputation in the industry?

**How to find out:**
- Glassdoor (filter for recent reviews)
- Blind (anonymous employee forums)
- LinkedIn (look at tenure and departures)
- Crunchbase or SEC filings (financial data)
- Back-channel references (talk to people who've worked there)

**Red flags:**
- High attrition, especially recent
- Negative press or legal issues
- Multiple rounds of layoffs
- Leadership instability

## The Decision Matrix

Create a simple scoring system. Rate each dimension 1-10 and weight them by importance to you.

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Weight | Weighted Score |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Role | 8 | 20% | 1.6 |
| Manager | 9 | 25% | 2.25 |
| Compensation | 7 | 20% | 1.4 |
| Trajectory | 6 | 20% | 1.2 |
| Company | 7 | 15% | 1.05 |
| **Total** | | | **7.5** |

Do this for each offer you're comparing. It forces you to think systematically instead of emotionally.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Focusing Only on Salary
A $20k salary bump means nothing if you leave in 6 months because the manager is terrible or the role is misaligned.

### Mistake 2: Overvaluing Equity
Equity in a startup is a lottery ticket. Don't trade real compensation for paper money unless you've done the risk analysis.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Manager
The #1 predictor of job satisfaction is your relationship with your manager. This deserves serious diligence.

### Mistake 4: Rushing the Decision
You can usually ask for more time. "I'm very excited about this opportunity. Could I have until [date] to give you a final answer?" Most companies will say yes.

### Mistake 5: Not Negotiating
Almost everything is negotiable. More salary, more equity, sign-on bonus, start date, title, scope. If you don't ask, the answer is always no.

## What You'll Walk Away With

When you evaluate an offer properly, you get:

- **A clear framework** for comparing your options
- **Due diligence checklist** for role, manager, and company
- **Compensation analysis** that goes beyond base salary
- **Confidence** in your decision—whether you take it or not
- **Negotiation leverage** because you know what you actually want

The goal isn't to find the perfect job. It's to make a well-informed decision that you can commit to without second-guessing.
