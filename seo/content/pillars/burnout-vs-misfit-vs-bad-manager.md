## Why the Diagnosis Matters

Most people who are miserable at work describe their situation the same way: "I'm burned out." But burnout is only one of three common conditions, and treating the wrong one wastes time and often makes things worse.

**The three conditions:**
1. **Burnout** — You're depleted from sustained overwork without adequate recovery
2. **Misfit** — The role, company, or industry isn't right for you
3. **Bad Manager** — The job could be great, but your boss is the problem

Each has different symptoms, different root causes, and different solutions. Let's figure out which one you're dealing with.

## The Diagnostic Framework

Answer these questions honestly. Most people have elements of all three, but one is usually dominant.

### Signs You're Burned Out

Burnout is about depletion. It's what happens when output exceeds recovery for too long.

**Key indicators:**
- You used to love this work, but now you feel nothing
- Weekends don't recharge you anymore
- Small tasks feel overwhelming
- You're making more mistakes than usual
- Your body is signaling distress (sleep issues, headaches, appetite changes)
- You fantasize about a long break more than a different job
- You've been running unsustainably for 6+ months

**The test:** If you imagine having this exact job but with half the workload and a month off, would you want to stay? If yes, you're probably burned out, not misfit.

**What burnout requires:**
- Rest (real rest, not "working from home")
- Boundary changes (scope reduction, delegation, saying no)
- System changes (if the workload is structural, rest alone won't fix it)

### Signs You're a Misfit

Misfit is about alignment. The role, company, or industry isn't right for who you are or who you want to become.

**Key indicators:**
- You don't care about the company's mission (and you've tried)
- Your strengths aren't what this role needs
- You're playing a character at work—not yourself
- The work that energizes your colleagues drains you
- You keep getting feedback that feels like "be someone else"
- Success in this role doesn't excite you
- You've felt this way since early on, not just recently

**The test:** If a great manager took over tomorrow and you had reasonable workload, would you want to stay? If no, you're probably misfit.

**What misfit requires:**
- Honest assessment of what you actually want
- Either an internal move to a better-fitting role
- Or an external move to a company/industry that fits
- Clarity on your non-negotiables for the next role

### Signs You Have a Bad Manager

Bad manager is about the relationship. The job itself could be great, but the person above you is the problem.

**Key indicators:**
- You were happy here before this manager arrived
- Other people report similar issues with this person
- You get blamed for things outside your control
- You're excluded from decisions you should be part of
- Feedback is vague, contradictory, or delivered through back channels
- You feel surveilled rather than supported
- Your manager takes credit for your work or throws you under the bus
- You've tried to address the relationship and it hasn't helped

**The test:** If this manager left tomorrow and you got a great replacement, would you want to stay? If yes, you're dealing with a bad manager, not burnout or misfit.

**What a bad manager requires:**
- Documenting the pattern (for yourself and potentially HR)
- Attempting a direct conversation (one time, clearly)
- Escalation if the behavior crosses lines
- Often: an exit, because bad managers rarely change

## The Overlap Problem

Here's what makes this hard: these conditions feed each other.

- A **bad manager** can cause burnout (through unreasonable demands and lack of support)
- **Burnout** can make you feel like a misfit (because you've lost touch with what you care about)
- Being a **misfit** accelerates burnout (because you're spending energy pretending)

So you need to identify the **primary driver**. Ask: "What came first? What would need to change for me to feel okay again?"

If you fix the burnout but you're still a misfit, you'll burn out again. If you leave a bad manager but join another one, nothing changes. Get the diagnosis right.

## The Action Matrix

Once you know what you're dealing with, here's the decision tree:

### If You're Burned Out:
1. **Can you reduce load?** Talk to your manager about scope. If yes, try it for 8 weeks.
2. **Can you take real time off?** A week minimum, ideally two. No email.
3. **Is the overwork structural?** If the company can't function without burning people out, this won't improve.
4. **Are you willing to enforce boundaries?** If not, the burnout will recur.

### If You're a Misfit:
1. **Is there a better role internally?** Some companies will move you. Ask.
2. **What would a good fit look like?** Write it down. Be specific.
3. **How long can you sustain this?** Misfit is survivable short-term, toxic long-term.
4. **What's your timeline to exit?** Put a date on it. Without one, you'll drift.

### If You Have a Bad Manager:
1. **Have you named the problem clearly (once)?** One direct, professional conversation.
2. **Is this person going to change?** In most cases, no. Be honest about this.
3. **Is there an internal option?** Lateral moves sometimes work.
4. **Are you documenting?** If this is harassment or discrimination, you need a record.
5. **What's your exit plan?** Start networking now, before you're desperate.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating Everything as Burnout
Rest won't fix a misfit situation. It might give you temporary relief, but you'll slide back quickly. If you've taken vacations and still dread returning, the problem isn't rest.

### Mistake 2: Blaming Yourself for a Bad Manager
Bad managers have a way of making you feel like the problem. If multiple people have struggled under this person, if the feedback you get is contradictory, if you were successful before—it's not you.

### Mistake 3: Quitting Without Diagnosing
Leaving a burnout situation for another high-intensity role recreates the problem. Leaving a misfit situation for a similar role does too. Leaving a bad manager for a company with the same management culture—same outcome.

Before you quit, know what you're leaving and what you're looking for.

### Mistake 4: Waiting Too Long
All three conditions get worse over time. Burnout deepens. Misfit becomes identity erosion. Bad managers escalate. The cost of staying isn't static—it compounds.

## A Real Example

**The situation:** A VP of Engineering at a Series C startup. Exhausted, cynical, dreading every week. Self-diagnosed as burned out.

**The diagnosis:** After working through the framework, she realized the primary issue was misfit. She'd joined to build technical systems but the role had become mostly political—managing up, navigating exec conflict, doing budget battles. The skills that made her successful as an engineer weren't the skills this role needed.

The burnout was real, but it was secondary. She was depleted because she was spending enormous energy on work that didn't fit her strengths.

**The path forward:** She started looking for roles at smaller companies where the VP Engineering was still technical. She found one within three months. The hours are similar, but she's energized because the work fits.

If she'd just taken a vacation, she would have come back to the same mismatch.

## What You'll Walk Away With

When you work through this diagnostic—whether on your own or with a coach—you get:

- **Clarity on the root cause:** Not just symptoms, but what's actually driving your unhappiness
- **A tailored action plan:** Different paths for burnout, misfit, and bad manager
- **Conversation scripts:** What to say to your manager, HR, or partner depending on the situation
- **A decision framework:** Stay, go, or pivot—with the reasoning laid out

The goal isn't to feel better temporarily. It's to understand what's broken so you can fix the right thing.
