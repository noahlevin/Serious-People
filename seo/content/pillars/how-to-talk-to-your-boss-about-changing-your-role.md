## Why This Conversation Is Hard

Talking to your boss about changing your role feels risky because it is. You're exposing what you want, which makes you vulnerable. You're asking for something, which might be refused. You're changing the dynamic, which feels uncertain.

But here's the reality: most role changes don't happen because people ask well. They happen because people hint, wait, get frustrated, and eventually leave.

Asking well is the better path.

## When to Have the Conversation

**It's the right time if:**
- You've been in your current role for at least 12 months
- You've been performing well (not fixing performance issues)
- You have a clear idea of what you want
- You've done the groundwork (more on this below)
- You can make a case for why it's good for the company

**It's the wrong time if:**
- You're in the middle of a crisis or major project launch
- You've just received difficult feedback
- The company is going through major upheaval
- You're uncertain about what you actually want
- You haven't yet demonstrated readiness

## Before You Ask: The Groundwork

The conversation will go better if you've done prep work before you walk in.

### 1. Define What You Want

Be specific. "More responsibility" is vague. "I want to take over the enterprise sales segment" is specific.

**Questions to answer:**
- What role or scope are you asking for?
- What responsibilities would change?
- What would you stop doing?
- What title would be appropriate?
- What compensation change would you expect? (You might not mention this in the first conversation, but know it)

### 2. Make the Business Case

Why should your boss say yes? Think from their perspective.

**Good reasons:**
- You're already doing this work and should be recognized for it
- The team needs this function and you're the best person to own it
- This change would make the team more effective
- You've demonstrated readiness through your performance

**Weak reasons:**
- You've been here a while and deserve it
- Someone else has this title and you want parity
- You're bored

### 3. Demonstrate Readiness

Before asking for new scope, show you can handle it.

- Volunteer for stretch assignments
- Lead a project in the new area
- Build relationships with stakeholders you'd work with
- Document your accomplishments in the current role
- Get feedback that supports your readiness

### 4. Know Your Alternatives

If the answer is no, what's your backup plan? Options include:

- Waiting and trying again in 6 months
- Looking for the role externally
- Accepting a smaller change as a stepping stone
- Staying where you are (for how long?)

Don't make threats. But know your own options.

## The Conversation Framework

### Step 1: Set Up the Meeting

Request a one-on-one specifically for "career development" or "my role." Don't spring this in a regular check-in.

**The request:**
"I'd like to schedule time to talk about my role and where I see it going. Can we find 30-45 minutes in the next couple of weeks?"

### Step 2: Open with Context

Start by establishing that you're happy and engaged, and that this is about growth, not complaints.

**The opener:**
"I really appreciate the opportunities I've had here, and I've loved working on [specific thing]. I want to talk about where I see my role going and how I can continue to grow."

### Step 3: Make the Ask

Be direct. Don't hint or wait for them to guess.

**The ask:**
"I'd like to take on [specific responsibility/role]. I think I'm ready because [evidence], and I believe it would benefit the team because [business case]."

### Step 4: Listen

Stop talking. Let them respond. They might need time to think. They might have questions. They might say yes immediately.

**What to listen for:**
- Initial reaction (positive, hesitant, surprised)
- Questions they ask (these reveal their concerns)
- What they say is possible or not possible
- What conditions or timeline they mention

### Step 5: Handle Objections

They might raise concerns. Address them directly.

**If they say you're not ready:**
"I'd love to understand what readiness would look like. What would I need to demonstrate?"

**If they say there's no role available:**
"I understand the structure isn't there right now. What would need to change for this to be possible?"

**If they say it's not the right time:**
"I can appreciate that. Can we agree on when to revisit this?"

### Step 6: Agree on Next Steps

Don't leave without clarity on what happens next.

**The close:**
"Thanks for hearing me out. What's the best next step? Should we schedule a follow-up in [timeframe]?"

## Scripts for Common Scenarios

### Asking for a Promotion

"I've been in this role for [X years] and consistently exceeded expectations in [specific areas]. I'd like to be considered for promotion to [title]. I've already taken on [examples of expanded scope], and I think making it official would reflect the work I'm doing. What would it take to make that happen?"

### Asking for a Scope Change

"I'd like to shift my focus from [current area] to [new area]. I've noticed that [reason this makes sense for the team], and I think I could make a bigger impact there. I'd like to discuss how we could make that transition."

### Asking for a Transfer

"I've really valued my time on this team. I'm interested in exploring a move to [other team/role] because [specific reason]. I wanted to talk to you first before pursuing anything, and get your support for the transition."

### Asking for More Authority

"I've been running [project/area] operationally, but I'm often in situations where I need to escalate decisions that I think I should be empowered to make. I'd like to discuss formally owning [specific decisions/scope] so I can move faster and take more off your plate."

## What to Do If the Answer Is No

A no isn't always final. But it tells you important information.

**If it's "not yet":**
- Clarify what readiness looks like
- Set a timeline to revisit (3-6 months)
- Document the criteria
- Follow up on schedule

**If it's "not here":**
- Understand why (role doesn't exist, budget, politics)
- Decide if you're willing to wait for circumstances to change
- Start exploring external options if the wait is too long

**If it's "not for you":**
- Ask for honest feedback on gaps
- Decide if those gaps are fixable
- Consider whether this is the right place for your goals

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Waiting to Be Noticed
Hoping your manager will spontaneously offer you more is not a strategy. If you want something, ask for it.

### Mistake 2: Vague Asks
"I want to grow" doesn't give your manager anything to work with. Be specific about what you want.

### Mistake 3: Ultimatums
"Promote me or I'll leave" rarely works as intended. It damages trust even if they say yes.

### Mistake 4: Wrong Timing
Asking during a crisis, right after a failure, or when the company is unstable reduces your chances significantly.

### Mistake 5: Not Following Up
If they said "let's revisit in three months," put it on the calendar. They probably won't raise it again—you need to.

## What You'll Walk Away With

When you prepare for this conversation properly, you get:

- **A clear ask** you can articulate confidently
- **A business case** that addresses your manager's perspective
- **Scripts** for different scenarios and objections
- **A plan B** if the answer isn't what you hoped
- **Clarity** on whether this company can give you what you want

The goal isn't just to get a yes. It's to get clarity—and to take control of your career development instead of waiting for it to happen to you.
