## Why How You Leave Matters

The way you resign echoes for years. Your references, your network, your reputation in the industry—all of it is shaped by how you handle your exit. People remember bad departures.

More practically: you will likely work with these people again. Industries are small. That VP you resign to might be the hiring manager at your next company. That peer who watches you leave might be the person who recommends you (or doesn't) five years from now.

Leaving well isn't about being nice. It's about being strategic.

## The Resignation Sequence

### Step 1: Prepare Before You Say Anything

Before you walk into your manager's office, you need to have several things ready:

**Your offer situation:**
- Is your new offer signed? (Don't resign on a verbal offer)
- Is there a start date? (You need this for your transition plan)
- Is there flexibility in the start date? (Helpful for negotiating notice period)

**Your transition plan:**
- What are the critical projects you own?
- Who could take over each one?
- What documentation needs to exist?
- What would a good handoff look like?

**Your message:**
- Practice saying it out loud
- Have your talking points written down
- Know what you will and won't share about your next role

### Step 2: The Resignation Conversation

This conversation should be short, clear, and professional. Here's the structure:

**The script:**

"I wanted to let you know that I've decided to move on. My last day will be [date, typically 2 weeks out]. I'm grateful for the opportunity here, and I want to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible."

That's it. You don't need to:
- Over-explain your reasons
- Apologize excessively
- Promise to stay in touch if you don't mean it
- Share details about your next role unless you want to

**If they ask why:**
Keep it brief and positive. "I was approached with an opportunity that's a great fit for my career goals right now." You don't owe them a detailed explanation.

**If they make a counteroffer:**
"I appreciate that, and it means a lot. But I've made my decision. I'd rather focus on making sure the transition goes well."

(Counteroffers are almost always a bad idea to accept—more on that later.)

**If they react badly:**
Stay calm. "I understand this is difficult timing. I want to help make this as smooth as possible." Don't match their energy.

### Step 3: The Notice Period

Two weeks is standard in the US for most roles. For senior positions, you might offer more.

**How to determine your notice:**
- What's standard at your company?
- What does your new employer need?
- How complex is the handoff?
- What's your relationship with your manager?

**The negotiation:**
If your company asks for more time, you can negotiate with your new employer—most will accommodate an extra week or two. If your company wants you gone immediately (rare, but it happens), you have an unexpected break before starting.

**During the notice period:**
- Document everything critical
- Train your replacement if one exists
- Don't check out mentally—finish strong
- Have handoff meetings with key stakeholders
- Tie up loose ends on projects
- Collect what you need (performance reviews, contact info, etc.)

### Step 4: The Goodbye Tour

Before your last day, have brief conversations with:

- Your direct reports (if applicable)
- Your key peers
- Your skip-level (your manager's manager, if appropriate)
- Anyone who's been a mentor or sponsor

**The script:**

"I wanted to let you know personally that I'm leaving at the end of the week. I've really valued working with you, and I hope we can stay in touch."

Keep it warm but not dramatic. Exchange personal contact info if appropriate.

### Step 5: The Last Day

- Send a brief, professional farewell email
- Don't badmouth anyone or anything
- Thank people specifically if warranted
- Leave your contact information (personal email, LinkedIn)
- Return equipment, badges, etc.
- Be gracious even if you're relieved to leave

## The Counteroffer Trap

About half of people who accept counteroffers leave within 18 months anyway. Here's why:

1. **The underlying problems don't change.** You wanted to leave for reasons beyond money. Those reasons are still there.
2. **Trust is damaged.** Your manager now knows you were looking. That changes the relationship.
3. **You become a flight risk.** When layoffs come, guess who's on the list?
4. **It's often a delay tactic.** The company needs time to replace you. Once they do, your leverage is gone.

If your company could have given you more money, better title, or improved conditions—why did it take your resignation to make it happen?

Counteroffers are almost never the right choice. Politely decline and move on.

## Difficult Resignation Scenarios

### When Your Boss Reacts Badly

Some managers take resignations personally. They might:
- Guilt trip you ("After everything I've done for you...")
- Get angry ("This is so unprofessional")
- Try to sabotage ("I'll have to think about what I can say in a reference")

Stay calm. Don't engage with the emotional content. Repeat: "I've made my decision. I'd like to focus on a smooth transition."

If they threaten your reference, document it. Consider involving HR if necessary.

### When You're Leaving for a Competitor

Be especially careful here. Don't:
- Discuss the competitor's strategy
- Take any proprietary information
- Recruit your colleagues (at least not right away)
- Badmouth your current company

You might be asked to leave immediately (garden leave). That's okay—it's often paid. Review your employment agreement for non-compete clauses.

### When You're Leaving During a Crisis

If your departure comes at an awkward time (middle of a launch, during layoffs, etc.), you might feel guilty. But:

- There's never a perfect time
- The company will survive
- Your responsibility is to give appropriate notice and transition well
- You can't set yourself on fire to keep others warm

Offer what you can reasonably offer. A slightly extended notice period is fine. Staying indefinitely because "it's a bad time" is not.

### When You Haven't Told Your Manager First

If news of your resignation leaks before you've told your manager directly, handle it immediately. Go to them and say:

"I was planning to tell you today, and I'm sorry you heard about this another way. I wanted you to hear it from me first."

Apologize for the miscommunication, then proceed with your standard resignation message.

## The All-Hands Announcement

Often, your departure will be announced to the broader team. You may or may not have control over this. If you do:

- Keep the message brief and positive
- Thank people sincerely
- Don't share where you're going unless you want to
- Don't make it about what was wrong with the company

If you don't have control over the message, accept it. You can correct the record individually with people who matter.

## What You'll Walk Away With

When you plan your resignation properly, you get:

- **Scripts for every conversation:** The manager talk, the counteroffer decline, the peer goodbyes
- **A transition timeline:** What to do each day of your notice period
- **Relationship preservation:** Leaving doors open for future opportunities
- **Documentation:** What to collect before you lose access
- **Peace of mind:** Knowing you handled it professionally

The goal isn't to escape. It's to exit in a way that you'll be proud of five years from now.
