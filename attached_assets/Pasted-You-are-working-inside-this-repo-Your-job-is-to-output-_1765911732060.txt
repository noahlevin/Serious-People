You are working inside this repo. Your job is to output a complete Lovable Design Handoff Pack so a separate AI design/build tool (Lovable) can redesign the entire front-end without having access to logged-in pages.

Constraints:

You MUST touch every part of the front-end: landing page, marketing pages, SEO/programmatic content pages, auth pages, and all in-app pages (including logged-in-only routes).

Lovable can browse the web to see public pages, but cannot log in or interact with the authenticated app.

Therefore you must fully describe authenticated pages, states, and data requirements from the codebase.

Do NOT actually change code. Only inspect and document.

Output must be a single markdown document with clear headings and code excerpts only where necessary.

Deliverable format: create a file named LOVABLE_HANDOFF.md in the repo root.

In LOVABLE_HANDOFF.md, include the following sections with real, repo-specific details:

Executive summary

What the app is (1–2 paragraphs), who it’s for, and the primary user journey.

What “design overhaul” means here (scope + what must not change functionally).

Tech stack + rendering model

Framework (Next.js/React/etc.), router type, SSR/SSG usage, styling system (Tailwind/CSS modules/etc.), component library (if any).

Where the “frontend boundary” is (what’s considered UI vs backend).

How environment variables affect UI.

Navigation + Information architecture

A complete sitemap table of ALL routes:

Route path

Public vs auth-required

Page purpose

Primary components used

Data dependencies (API calls, server props, etc.)

Key page states (empty/loading/error/success)

Include both marketing + app routes.

Design inventory (current UI surface audit)
For each page/route group, document:

Layout pattern (header/footer/sidebar)

Typography hierarchy used

Button/link styles

Form patterns

Card/table patterns

Modal/drawer usage

Alert/toast usage

Empty states

Error states

Loading states (spinners/skeletons)

Component catalog (source-of-truth list)

List every reusable component (or every component directory) with:

Component name

File path

Purpose

Props (summarize)

Variants/states

Where it’s used (routes)

Also list shared design tokens if present (colors, spacing, breakpoints).

Auth + logged-in page simulation plan (critical)
Since Lovable can’t log in, you must document:

Auth flow screens and logic (login, magic link, callback, logout)

Post-login “home” route and what it shows

Any role-based UI differences

All logged-in routes and their intended UI

Provide “state snapshots” for each logged-in page:

Example data shapes (JSON) the UI expects

Screens: first-time user, typical user, power user

Edge cases: no data, partial data, errors

Data contract: frontend ↔ API

Enumerate all endpoints the frontend calls (or all server actions), with:

Method + path

Auth requirements

Request shape (example)

Response shape (example)

Common error responses

Include any client-side caching/query library usage.

SEO + programmatic content requirements

Explain how SEO pages are generated today (routes, templates, content sources).

List all indexable pages + canonical rules.

Metadata strategy (title/description/open graph), including where code is.

Sitemap generation (if any).

Robots rules (if any).

Structured data (JSON-LD) usage (if any).

Internal linking patterns that must be preserved.

Copy + content map

Inventory of major copy blocks (hero, value props, FAQs, pricing, onboarding).

Where copy lives (hardcoded vs CMS/markdown/db).

Any content constraints (must keep exact wording for legal/pricing, etc.).

Analytics + tracking hooks

What analytics exists (if any), where events are fired, and “must not break” selectors/attributes.

Any A/B testing hooks.

Accessibility + responsiveness

Current breakpoints/responsive patterns.

Known a11y constraints (keyboard nav, focus states, color contrast).

Required semantic structure for SEO/a11y.

Non-goals + “do not break” list

URLs must remain stable (unless explicitly listed otherwise).

Auth/session must keep working.

Payments/pricing pages must keep working.

Any integration points that are fragile.

A “Lovable-ready” design brief (what to build)
Write a concise spec Lovable can execute:

Desired vibe (adjectives)

Visual references (leave placeholders like “[provide 3 links]”)

Layout principles

Component principles

Motion/interaction principles

What to standardize (buttons/forms/cards/tables)

What to improve most (top 10 UI problems observed in repo)

Appendix

Any relevant file tree snippets:

/pages or /app router structure

/components

/styles

/public

/seo or content directories

Include minimal code excerpts only when necessary to show data shapes or routing logic.

Implementation notes for you (Replit Agent):

You must actually scan the repo to populate this with accurate paths and routes. Don’t invent.

If a route is dynamic, list the pattern and examples.

If you find TODOs/placeholder components, flag them.

If content is behind auth, infer UI expectations by reading components and describing them.

Keep it tight but complete—this is a handoff document for a builder AI.

Now generate LOVABLE_HANDOFF.md with all required sections filled in with repo-specific details.
