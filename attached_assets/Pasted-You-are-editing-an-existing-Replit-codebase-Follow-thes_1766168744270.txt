You are editing an existing Replit codebase. Follow these rules strictly.

## 0) Ground rules (no pretending)
- Do NOT say “tests passed” unless you actually ran the commands in the Replit shell and paste the raw output.
- Do NOT do wide refactors. Make the smallest change that achieves the goal.
- Prefer surgical edits.
- Preserve server-owned journey/state machine and client route gating.

## 1) Goal (one sentence)
GOAL: Make Module pages (/module/:moduleNumber) render using the same Lovable interview/chat UI components as InterviewChat so the Modules experience matches the chat regime visually and structurally.

## 2) Scope boundaries
- You may edit ONLY these files (unless you ask first):
1) client/src/pages/module.tsx
2) client/src/lovable/components/interview/ChatMessage.tsx
3) client/src/lovable/components/interview/SectionDivider.tsx
4) client/src/lovable/components/interview/ChatInput.tsx
5) client/src/styles/serious-people.css

If you think other files are required, STOP and list the additional file paths and why.

## 3) Current behavior to preserve
- Preserve route gating/state machine behavior (no new transitions on page load).
- Preserve the module content order and any existing “moduleNumber” routing behavior.
- If module content is currently read-only, keep it read-only (do not introduce sending messages unless it already existed).
- Do not remove or deprecate client/src/components/ChatComponents.tsx in this change.

## 4) Implementation plan (small + explicit)
1) In module.tsx, replace usage of client/src/components/ChatComponents.tsx with Lovable interview components:
   - Use ChatMessage for message bubbles
   - Use SectionDivider for section breaks (if module content has sections; otherwise ignore)
   - Use ChatInput ONLY if modules currently allow user input; otherwise render it disabled/hidden.
2) Add a tiny “adapter” inside module.tsx that maps existing module message objects into the props expected by ChatMessage.
   - If module messages are plain strings, map them into { role: 'assistant' | 'user', content: string } equivalents.
3) If ChatMessage/ChatInput are too interview-specific (prop mismatch), extend them minimally:
   - Add optional props with safe defaults (do not break InterviewChat)
   - Do NOT change CSS class names used by interview pages.
4) Only adjust serious-people.css if there’s an obvious spacing/width mismatch on module pages after the component swap.

## 5) Exact edits
For each file you touch, produce:
- Path:
- Change type: (surgical edit | replace full contents)
- Diff-style summary (what changed and why)

## 6) Mandatory verification (must run and paste output)
After edits, run these commands in the Replit shell and paste raw output:

### Build / type sanity
1) `npm test` if it exists, else say “no test script found”
2) `npm run build` (or the closest equivalent in this repo)
3) `npm run lint` if it exists (otherwise state it doesn’t)

### Runtime checks (no UI click-through required)
4) Start server: `npm run dev` (or workspace default)
5) In a second shell (PORT is 5000), verify module route returns HTML (or at least not 500):
- `curl -i http://localhost:5000/app/module/1 | head -n 20`
  Success looks like: HTTP 200 (or 304) and `Content-Type: text/html` (or HTML body).
- Also verify bootstrap still works:
- `curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/bootstrap | node -e "let d='';process.stdin.on('data',c=>d+=c);process.stdin.on('end',()=>{const j=JSON.parse(d); console.log('ok bootstrap keys:', Object.keys(j));});"`

## 7) Acceptance criteria (must be met)
- Module page uses Lovable ChatMessage rendering (same bubble look as InterviewChat).
- No TypeScript build errors.
- /app/module/1 returns 200 and does not throw runtime errors in the server log.
- InterviewChat visuals and behavior are unchanged (no regressions).

## 8) If verification fails
Do NOT keep making random edits.
Instead:
- Paste the error output
- Give 2–3 most likely root causes (prop mismatch, message shape mismatch, missing import)
- Propose the smallest next diagnostic step (grep/tsc error focus)

## 9) Rollback note
If anything breaks, revert ONLY the touched files via git:
- `git diff` to review
- `git checkout -- <file>` for each touched file
