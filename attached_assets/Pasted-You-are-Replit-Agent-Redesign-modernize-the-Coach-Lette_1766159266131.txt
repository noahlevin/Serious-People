You are Replit Agent. Redesign + modernize the Coach Letter page so it matches the current Lovable design system and the new app architecture (react-router-dom + cached bootstrap auth). Keep behavior the same and avoid refactors.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT redesign the whole app—only this page.
- No page-level auth redirects and no calling refetch() on mount. Server gating + AuthProvider own auth.
- Replace wouter usage with react-router-dom.
- Keep the same backend endpoints:
  - GET /api/serious-plan/letter (poll until complete)
  - POST /api/serious-plan/letter/seen (then navigate to /serious-plan)
- Keep changes minimal and testable.
- Output:
  (1) diff-style summary
  (2) full contents of any changed files
  (3) pasted output from the Critical Verification commands at the end. If you cannot run commands, say so explicitly.

Files to edit:
1) client/src/pages/coach-letter.tsx
2) Create client/src/lovable/pages/CoachLetter.tsx (new) and convert the existing pages file into a wrapper, matching the pattern used by interview-chat and offer.

Implementation details:

A) Create a new Lovable page component:
- New file: client/src/lovable/pages/CoachLetter.tsx
- Use react-router-dom:
  - import { Link, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"
- Use useAuth() values:
  - authChecked, isAuthenticated
- React Query:
  - useQuery with queryKey: ["/api/serious-plan/letter"]
  - enabled: authChecked && isAuthenticated
  - refetchInterval: 2000 only while status is "pending" or "generating"; otherwise false
- useMutation for POST /api/serious-plan/letter/seen; onSuccess navigate("/serious-plan")

UI / Design (Lovable-ish, minimal):
- Header matches other Lovable pages:
  - border-b header
  - container class sp-container
  - logo Link should go to "/progress" (not "/")
  - UserMenu on right
- Body:
  - centered card-like container (use existing tokens/classes; you can reuse Card/Button components from your current UI libs if already used elsewhere)
  - Loading state: spinner + “Preparing your plan…”
  - Error state: simple message + button “Continue to Your Plan” (navigate("/serious-plan"))
  - Success state:
    - icon (GraduationCap or similar)
    - title “Your Serious Plan (with coach letter)”
    - render paragraphs split on blank lines
    - primary CTA button “Continue to Your Plan” posts seen then navigates
- Keep styling consistent with current app tokens; no pixel-perfect obsession, just clean.

B) Convert client/src/pages/coach-letter.tsx to a wrapper:
- Content should become:
  - import CoachLetter from "@/lovable/pages/CoachLetter";
  - export default function CoachLetterPage(){ return <CoachLetter/>; }

C) Remove old behaviors:
- Remove wouter useLocation entirely.
- Remove any useEffect that calls refetch() on mount.
- Remove redirect-to-/login logic. The server /app/* gate handles access control.

D) Keep behavior intact:
- The page should still poll until the letter is ready.
- Clicking continue should still POST seen and go to /serious-plan.

Critical Verification (must execute in Replit Shell and paste output)
1) Basic checks (skip gracefully if not present):
```bash
npm run lint --if-present
npm run typecheck --if-present
npm run test --if-present
npm run build --if-present
Confirm server responds:

bash
Copy code
PORT=${PORT:-5000}
curl -sS -i "http://localhost:${PORT}/api/bootstrap" | head -n 25
Confirm the route renders (no UI clicking required):

Just verify the SPA can load the route path (HTTP 200 from server for logged-in users is enough).

If you cannot simulate login, state that clearly.

bash
Copy code
PORT=${PORT:-5000}
curl -sS -I "http://localhost:${PORT}/app/coach-letter" | head -n 20
Also: do NOT claim “tests passed” unless you paste the command output.
