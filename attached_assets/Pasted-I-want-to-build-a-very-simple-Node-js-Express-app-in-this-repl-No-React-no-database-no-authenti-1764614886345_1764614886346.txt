I want to build a very simple Node.js + Express app in this repl. No React, no database, no authentication.

High-level behavior:

Serve a static landing page at / from public/index.html.

That page has a “Get my scripts – $19” button.

When clicked, the browser does a POST to /checkout using fetch. The server:

Creates a Stripe Checkout session (one-time payment) using a price id from process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_ID.

Returns { url: session.url }.

The browser then redirects window.location to that URL.

Stripe Checkout uses:

success_url = BASE_URL/success.html?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}

cancel_url = BASE_URL/
where BASE_URL is process.env.BASE_URL.

After payment, Stripe redirects to success.html with a session_id query param.

On success.html:

The page is served as static HTML from public/success.html.

It has inline JS that:

Reads session_id from window.location.search.

Calls GET /verify-session?session_id=....

If the response is OK, hides the “checking payment” message and shows an intake form.

If not OK, shows an error message (“could not verify payment”).

The intake form has the following fields (text inputs / textareas):

role

companyContext

whatsNotWorking

whatYouWant

bossAsk

partnerContext

runway

riskTolerance

On submit, the form does a fetch POST to /generate with JSON { role, companyContext, ... }.

Server routes (Express, in a single index.js file):

app.use(express.static("public")) to serve static files.

POST /checkout: uses Stripe secret key from process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY. Creates a Checkout session in mode: "payment" for process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_ID. Responds JSON { url: session.url }.

GET /verify-session: reads req.query.session_id, retrieves the Stripe checkout session, and if payment_status === "paid", responds { ok: true }. Otherwise responds with a 403 error.

POST /generate: reads the form fields from req.body, builds a prompt, sends it to the OpenAI Chat Completions API with model gpt-4.1-mini using process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, and responds { text: generatedText }.

Use express.json() for JSON bodies.

Prompt for /generate:
Please use this exact prompt, interpolating the form fields:

You are a candid but compassionate career coach.

User details:

Role: {{role}}

Company context: {{companyContext}}

What's not working: {{whatsNotWorking}}

What they want instead: {{whatYouWant}}

What they'd ask their boss for: {{bossAsk}}

Partner context: {{partnerContext}}

Financial runway: {{runway}}

Risk tolerance (1-5): {{riskTolerance}}

Produce three sections:

"Script for talking to my boss" – a conversational 2–3 minute script they can mostly read verbatim. Be honest but non-destructive. Model "disagree and commit" if staying is on the table.

"Script for talking to my partner" – empathetic, transparent about risk and money, asking for support, not just permission.

"Clarity memo" – one page with:

Summary of the situation

2–3 realistic options (e.g., stay and renegotiate, line up a new job then quit, sabbatical/independent)

Top 3 risks for each option

A concrete 30-day experiment.

Keep language plain, no corporate jargon, no AI-speak.
```

Constraints:

Keep everything in a single Express server file (e.g. index.js) plus static files in public/.

Do not add React, template engines, databases, or authentication.

Use environment variables for STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PRICE_ID, OPENAI_API_KEY, and BASE_URL. Do not expose them in client-side JavaScript.

Please scaffold the full app (server + two HTML pages) so I can test the flow end-to-end in Stripe test mode.
