You are editing an existing Replit codebase. Follow these rules strictly.

## 0) Ground rules (no pretending)
- Do NOT say “tests passed” unless you actually ran the commands in the Replit shell and paste the raw output.
- Do NOT do wide refactors. Make the smallest change that achieves the goal.
- Prefer “surgical edits.”
- Keep auth/state machine behavior unchanged.

## 1) Goal (one sentence)
GOAL: Add a lightweight debug page under /app that renders all inline chat components (title cards/dividers/etc.) so we can visually confirm they render correctly and have a shell-first smoke check.

## 2) Scope boundaries
- You may edit ONLY these files (unless you ask first):
client/src/routes.tsx (or wherever the SPA routes are defined)
client/src/pages/debug-chat-components.tsx (new)
client/src/lovable/components/interview/SectionDivider.tsx
client/src/lovable/components/interview/WelcomeCard.tsx
client/src/lovable/components/interview/UpsellCard.tsx

If the “title card” component lives elsewhere, STOP and list the exact file path(s) you need and why.

## 3) Current behavior to preserve
- Preserve existing route gating/state machine behavior.
- Debug page must be non-discoverable by users (simple gate).
- No changes to existing InterviewChat behavior.

## 4) Implementation plan (small + explicit)
1) Locate the SPA route config file (likely client/src/routes.tsx or similar) and add a debug route: /app/debug/chat-components.
2) Create a new page component that renders:
   - WelcomeCard
   - SectionDivider (multiple variants if it supports them)
   - UpsellCard
   - Any “title card” / inline card component used in chat (only if it exists; otherwise stop and report)
   Include visible headings and add simple sentinel attributes or text markers like:
   data-testid="debug-welcome-card", "debug-section-divider", etc.
3) Add a gate so this page only renders if a flag is enabled:
   - Prefer: import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG_UI === "1"
   - If not available, fallback to a query param like ?debug=1 and show a “disabled” message otherwise.

## 5) Exact edits
For each file you touch, produce:
- Path:
- Change type: (surgical edit | new file)
- Diff-style summary (what changed and why)

## 6) Mandatory verification (must run and paste output)
After edits, run these commands in the Replit shell and paste raw output:

### Build / type sanity
1) `npm test` if it exists, else skip and say “no test script found”
2) `npm run build` (or the closest equivalent)
3) `npm run lint` if it exists, else say it doesn’t

### Runtime checks
4) Start server: `npm run dev` (or workspace default)
5) In a second shell:
- `curl -i http://localhost:5000/app/debug/chat-components | head -n 20`
- `curl -s http://localhost:5000/app/debug/chat-components | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d);process.stdin.on('end',()=>{console.log(/debug-welcome-card/.test(s)&&/debug-section-divider/.test(s)&&/debug-upsell-card/.test(s)?'[PASS] sentinels found':'[FAIL] missing sentinels')})"`

### Output expectations
- Build completes without TypeScript errors.
- Curl returns 200 (or a clear “debug disabled” message) depending on gating.
- Sentinel check prints [PASS] when enabled.

## 7) Acceptance criteria (must be met)
- There is a stable debug route that renders the inline chat components.
- The page is gated (not generally accessible unless debug enabled).
- Shell-first verification can confirm it renders (sentinel check).

## 8) If verification fails
Do NOT keep making random edits.
Instead:
- Show the error output
- Give the 2–3 most likely root causes
- Propose the smallest next diagnostic step

## 9) Deliverables
A) Diff Summary
B) Raw command outputs from verification
C) One-liner on how to enable the debug gate (env var or query param)
