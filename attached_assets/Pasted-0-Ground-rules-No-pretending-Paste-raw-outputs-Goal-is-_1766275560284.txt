0) Ground rules
- No pretending. Paste raw outputs.
- Goal is to make smoke tests trustworthy, not merely passing.
- Separate DEV_FAST behavior from normal behavior. Do not weaken normal assertions.

1) Goal
Refactor scripts/smoke-interview-chat.mjs so:
- Normal mode is strict and fails on empty assistant replies
- DEV_FAST=1 runs a clearly-labeled deterministic suite that does NOT claim to validate LLM replies
- testskip/skiptest logic cannot accidentally make normal mode permissive

2) Scope (ONLY)
- scripts/smoke-interview-chat.mjs
- server/routes.ts (ONLY if needed to add an explicit response flag like skipped_llm=true for testskip mode)
- replit.md (update docs for smoke modes)

3) Required changes

A) Split into two explicit test suites
- runFastSuite() (DEV_FAST=1)
- runFullSuite() (default)

B) Full suite rules (default)
- Turn 1 and Turn 2 must produce non-empty assistant reply content.
- Retries are allowed (e.g., 2 retries, longer timeout), but if still empty -> FAIL.
- Full suite may still validate events (provided_name_set, etc.) but it must not treat events as a substitute for a reply.

C) Fast suite rules (DEV_FAST=1)
- Must NOT call the real LLM.
- Must validate deterministically:
  - GET /api/interview/state works
  - dev inject endpoints work (outcomes inject + select)
  - dev finalize endpoint works and produces:
    - final_next_steps event with modules length > 0
    - serious plan artifacts exist and are terminal
- Fast suite must log clearly: "FAST MODE: LLM not exercised"

D) Remove “planCard present => accept empty reply” from full suite
- If that rule is needed for testskip compatibility, confine it to FAST mode only.
- Ideally: add `skipped_llm:true` to the server response for testskip and require that flag in fast mode (optional but preferred).

E) Make skip/testskip behavior impossible to confuse
- If there is a skiptest helper, rename it to something explicit (e.g. callTurnFast vs callTurnLLM).
- Ensure the code path for DEV_FAST cannot be activated implicitly (only via env var).

4) Verification (paste raw outputs)
- npm run build
- node scripts/smoke-interview-chat.mjs   (default/full)
- DEV_FAST=1 node scripts/smoke-interview-chat.mjs
- node scripts/smoke-module-chat.mjs

5) Acceptance criteria
- Full mode fails if assistant replies are empty after retries.
- Fast mode passes quickly and clearly states it did not test the LLM.
- No permissive rule remains in full mode that could hide regressions.
- Docs updated explaining the two modes and when to use each.
