0) Ground rules
- No pretending. Paste raw outputs.
- Create ONE shared layout component (AppShell) used across all pages.
- Be extremely conservative about CSS:
  - Prefer a small set of dedicated `.sp-*` classes in serious-people.css
  - Do NOT mix Tailwind utility soup + inline styles + custom CSS on the same container element.
  - Avoid overlapping classes with conflicting padding/margins.
- No visual redesign—keep spacing similar to current “good” pages.

1) Goal
Introduce a shared AppShell (Header + Footer + main container) and apply it to ALL routes so:
- The user menu is always in the upper-right on every page
- Header height is consistent and not “way too tall”
- Footer is consistent
- Main content never hides behind header
- We reduce per-page layout duplication (less drift)

2) Scope (ONLY)
- client/src/components/AppShell.tsx (new)
- client/src/styles/serious-people.css (add only shell/header/footer styles; avoid touching unrelated rules)
- client/src/App.tsx (wrap routes with AppShell)
- Any page components that currently render their own header/footer (edit only to remove duplicated wrappers once AppShell is applied)

3) Discovery (required BEFORE edits)
- grep -R "<header" client/src || true
- grep -R "<footer" client/src || true
- grep -R "sp-interview-header" client/src/styles/serious-people.css || true
- Provide a short list of pages that currently implement their own header/footer and what classnames they use.

4) CSS hygiene guardrails (must enforce during migration)
These are the two classic failure modes—actively check for them and fix them:

A) Double padding / content offset bugs
- Watch for pages that already had padding-top / margin-top hacks for fixed headers
- If AppShell introduces main padding/offset, remove per-page offsets to avoid “double push-down”
- Confirm content is not hidden behind header and not overly pushed down

B) Conflicting height/layout definitions
- Avoid having header height defined in multiple places (e.g., Tailwind h-12 AND CSS padding/height rules)
- Single source of truth: define header sizing in ONE place (prefer the sp-shell-header CSS rule)
- Keep header child elements minimal; don’t stack multiple wrapper divs with their own spacing rules

5) Implementation requirements
A) AppShell structure
- <div className="sp-shell">
    <header className="sp-shell-header"> (logo/link left, <UserMenu/> right)
    <main className="sp-shell-main">{children}</main>
    <footer className="sp-shell-footer">...</footer>
  </div>

B) CSS: single-source header height + offsets
- Define header height once (CSS variable or explicit height)
- Ensure main top padding/margin matches header height
- Decide: header is either fixed everywhere or static everywhere. Pick one and apply consistently.

C) Migration
- Wrap all routes in App.tsx with AppShell.
- Remove per-page headers/footers that would result in duplicates.
- Remove per-page padding-top/margin-top hacks that compensated for fixed headers (if header is fixed).

D) Safety against CSS conflicts
- When removing per-page header markup, also remove conflicting classes if no longer used.
- Do NOT delete global CSS unless grep confirms it is unused.

6) Visual verification (required)
After implementation, manually inspect (in browser) EACH of these routes at:
- Mobile width (~390px)
- Tablet width (~768px)
- Desktop width (~1200px+)

Routes to check:
- /
- /interview/start
- /interview/prepare
- /interview/chat
- /module/1
- /seriousplan

For each, confirm explicitly:
- Exactly one header rendered
- UserMenu present (when logged in)
- Header height reasonable (not too tall)
- Content not hidden behind header
- Footer rendered and not overlapping content
- No horizontal overflow / weird wrapping at small widths

7) Verification (paste raw outputs)
- npm run build
- node scripts/smoke-interview-chat.mjs
- node scripts/smoke-module-chat.mjs
- grep -R "<header" client/src | head -n 50
- grep -R "<footer" client/src | head -n 50

8) Acceptance criteria
- Every page has a single consistent header with UserMenu.
- Header height consistent and not oversized at all widths.
- No double headers, no hidden content behind header, no double padding.
- Footer present and stable across pages.
- Build + both smokes pass.
