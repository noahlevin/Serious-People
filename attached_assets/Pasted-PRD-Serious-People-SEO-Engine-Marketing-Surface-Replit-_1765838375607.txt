PRD: Serious People SEO Engine + Marketing Surface (Replit, Single Deployment)
1. Purpose

Serious People needs a scalable acquisition engine that (a) drives organic traffic, (b) converts that traffic into sessions, and (c) later supports paid ads with intent-matched landing pages—all while avoiding disruption to the existing SPA and remaining reusable for future products.

This project will add an HTML-first marketing/SEO surface (guides, tools, landing pages) to the existing app, powered by a taxonomy-driven page generation system (“SEO engine”) with a built-in quality gate to prevent thin/duplicate content.

2. Goals

Launch crawlable, indexable, high-quality content pages that can rank for high-intent queries relevant to career decisions.

Implement a reusable, taxonomy-driven system to generate programmatic pages without harming site quality.

Add 2–4 interactive tools that act as conversion engines and future PPC landing pages.

Maintain a single deployment and same-domain routing on Replit.

Preserve current app behavior at / during early phases.

3. Non-goals

Rewriting the core product app or migrating the full experience to Next.js.

Building a full CMS or editorial workflow (can be added later).

Shipping hundreds/thousands of programmatic pages immediately.

International SEO / localization in v1.

4. Success metrics
Primary

Index coverage: >90% of intended SEO pages indexed (excluding deliberately noindex pages).

Organic acquisition: measurable impressions/clicks in Search Console within 2–4 weeks of launch (timing varies).

Conversion: trackable funnel from SEO pages → CTA → session start → purchase.

Secondary

Tool engagement: tool completion rate and CTA click-through from tools.

Paid readiness: ability to create noindex message-matched landing pages under /lp/*.

5. Users and intent
Primary search intents we serve

“I’m stuck” decision intent: stay vs go, pivot vs persist, burnout vs misfit.

Negotiation intent: severance, exit messaging, comp, offer evaluation.

Narrative intent: explaining departure, updating LinkedIn, interview story.

Planning intent: 14-day plan, job search plan, ramp plan.

Personas (high-level)

Mid-to-senior operators (product/eng/ops) and exec-adjacent leaders.

People in active transition or contemplating it.

6. Constraints and assumptions

Current app is a React SPA (Vite + wouter) at /.

Backend is Express + TypeScript; single Replit deployment; custom domain seriouspeople.app.

No Cloudflare/edge rewrites—routing must be done in Express.

Same-domain preferred for auth/cookies and simple UX.

7. Strategy overview
Architecture approach

Add a separate SEO/marketing build (recommended: Astro) that outputs static HTML.

Serve that HTML through Express for /guides/*, /tools/*, /lp/*.

Keep SPA at / in early phases.

Optionally mount SPA at /app later, then (optionally) flip / to marketing for logged-out users.

Content approach

8–12 pillar pages (handwritten) as authoritative hubs.

25–50 programmatic pages in the first batch (highest intent only).

Tools as conversion surfaces and paid-ad landing page bases.

Internal-link graph to connect pillars ↔ programmatic ↔ tools.

Source of truth

Taxonomy, pillars, and initial generated page list live in:
/docs/seo_taxonomy_and_pillars.md

A machine-readable canonical taxonomy file must be generated and committed (JSON/YAML).

8. Requirements
8.1 Routing requirements (v1)

/guides/* must serve HTML-first pages (indexable by default if quality gate passes).

/tools/* must serve HTML-first pages with client-side interactive components.

/lp/* must serve landing pages intended for ads; default noindex.

/robots.txt and /sitemap.xml must be served from the root domain.

Existing SPA behavior at / must not change until Phase 6.

8.2 SEO technical requirements

Each SEO page must support:

Title tag and meta description

Canonical URL

OpenGraph/Twitter tags

Optional JSON-LD (Article, FAQ, Breadcrumb) where appropriate

Sitemap generation:

Includes only indexable pages

Supports lastmod when available

Robots:

Disallow indexing of app-private paths (auth, payments, user content)

Allow indexing of /guides/* and /tools/*

404 handling for missing SEO routes.

8.3 Programmatic SEO engine requirements

Taxonomy-driven page generation using a deterministic “page composer.”

Required content modules per page:

Framework section (how to think about it)

Common mistakes (role/situation specific)

Example vignette (anonymized but concrete)

“What you’ll walk away with” tied to product artifacts

Single primary CTA

Related internal links (generated)

Content variation:

Modules must have variants to avoid near-duplicate pages.

Quality gate:

Pages failing quality checks must render with noindex

Sitemap must exclude noindex pages

8.4 Tools requirements (v1)

Ship at least two tools:

Stay/Go Worksheet (scored or structured output)

Severance/Runway Calculator

Tools should:

Work without login

Be fast and mobile-friendly

Have clear CTA to start Serious People session

Emit PostHog events (see Analytics section)

8.5 Analytics requirements

PostHog events for SEO surface:

seo_page_viewed (include slug and taxonomy dimensions)

seo_cta_clicked (include destination)

tool_started, tool_completed, tool_cta_clicked

Funnel attribution:

Carry UTM params from SEO/LP pages into the app checkout/session start.

(Optional) Add a lightweight “SEO cohort” property to users who enter from /guides or /tools.

9. UX/content requirements

Guides should be skimmable:

Clear headings, short paragraphs

Simple “framework” visuals/sections (text-only in v1)

CTA strategy:

Exactly one primary CTA per page (avoid choice paralysis)

Secondary links only as internal navigation (pillars/tools)

Strong message match for /lp/* pages:

Minimal nav, focused offer, tailored copy

Default noindex until explicitly launched

10. Milestones and phased delivery
Phase 0 — Taxonomy + repo scaffolding

Create /docs/seo_taxonomy_and_pillars.md

Commit canonical JSON taxonomy file

Add /seo/README.md

Acceptance:

Taxonomy exists; no behavior changes.

Phase 1 — SEO build + serve a single guide page

Add Astro in /seo

Build one pillar guide page

Express serves /guides/<slug> HTML

Acceptance:

Page is crawlable (view-source shows content); / unchanged.

Phase 2 — Pillars + sitemap/robots + guides index

Implement 8–12 pillar pages

/guides index

/robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, 404

Acceptance:

Sitemap/robots validate; pillars browsable.

Phase 3 — Programmatic pages + quality gate

Page composer + module library

Generate first 25–50 pages from taxonomy

Quality gate + sitemap excludes noindex

Acceptance:

Programmatic pages render; only high-quality are indexable.

Phase 4 — Tools + LP routes + instrumentation

Build 2 tools under /tools

Add /lp/* pages (noindex)

PostHog instrumentation

Acceptance:

Tools work; events fire; LP pages exist.

Phase 5 — Optional /app mount (no migration)

Serve SPA under /app

Ensure routing/auth works

Acceptance:

/app mirrors existing app; / unchanged.

Phase 6 — Flip / to marketing for logged-out users (optional)

Logged out: / serves marketing HTML

Logged in: / redirects to /app

Acceptance:

Returning users feel no disruption; homepage becomes SEO-capable.

11. Risks and mitigations

Risk: Thin/duplicate pSEO harms domain quality
Mitigation: quality gate + small initial batch + module variants + manual review of top pages.

Risk: Routing conflicts with SPA catch-all
Mitigation: add explicit Express routes for /guides|/tools|/lp before SPA handler.

Risk: Analytics attribution breaks across surfaces
Mitigation: standard UTM pass-through and PostHog properties on session start.

Risk: SEO surface looks disconnected from app
Mitigation: shared minimal design tokens; consistent CTAs; link to /app later.

12. Open questions (optional—answer in the taxonomy file)

Final list of taxonomy values (roles/situations/goals) and initial page batch

CTA choice: “Start session” vs “Try tool” as primary CTA per intent

Whether to index tools pages or keep some as noindex until mature

13. Deliverables checklist

/docs/seo_taxonomy_and_pillars.md

/seo Astro app + build scripts

Express routing updates (serve /guides, /tools, /lp, robots, sitemap)

Page composer + module library

Quality gate + sitemap logic

8–12 pillar pages

25–50 programmatic pages

2 tools pages

PostHog events

Optional /app mount + optional / flip
