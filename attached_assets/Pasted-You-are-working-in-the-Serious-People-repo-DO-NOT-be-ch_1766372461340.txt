You are working in the Serious People repo.

DO NOT be chatty. DO NOT hand-wave. DO NOT say “done” without proof.

ABSOLUTE OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (non-negotiable)
1) Provide a concise diff summary by file (what changed + why).
2) Provide RAW command outputs for:
   - npm run build
   - node scripts/smoke-module-chat.mjs
   - DEV_FAST=1 node scripts/smoke-interview-chat.mjs
3) If you skip anything, say exactly what was skipped and why.
4) If you change UI behavior, do a visual check at ~390px, ~768px, ~1200px and report what you saw.

CSS HYGIENE GUARDRAILS (must follow)
- Prefer existing classes; do not introduce new global styles unless unavoidable.
- No inline styles unless there’s a strong reason.
- Avoid adding multiple overlapping classes that fight (be explicit and minimal).
- If you touch layout CSS, confirm there’s a single source of truth (AppShell + serious-people.css).

CONTEXT
We use an event-driven UI architecture for interview + module chat:
- Title cards, section headers, structured outcomes, etc are appended via tool calls and stored in app_events.
- Structured outcomes UI intentionally does NOT render the “prompt” field — only options.

GOALS (do these in order)

Goal 1 — Remove footer on Login page only
- The login page should not show the AppShell footer.
- Do NOT remove the footer globally.
- Implement using existing AppShell API if possible (e.g. hideFooter prop or route-based logic).
Acceptance criteria:
- Login page: no footer.
- Other pages: unchanged.

Goal 2 — Add tasteful loading state for interview + module chat
Problem: There is a noticeable delay before the first title card / first assistant message appears. During that delay, the chat area looks “dead”.
Solution:
- In InterviewChat and the module chat page, while initial state is loading (before transcript/events render), show a subtle loader/watermark:
  - Text: “Starting your interview…” (interview) / “Starting this module…” (module)
  - Small spinner icon
  - Should not shift layout when content loads.
- Composer should remain pinned to bottom as it is today.
Acceptance criteria:
- On a cold load of /app/interview/chat: loader appears immediately, then disappears when state is ready.
- Same for module chat route.

Goal 3 — Fix “after name” flow so the question is always in the assistant message
Current bug:
- After the user provides their name, the assistant often says “Great to meet you, <name>.” but fails to ask “How would you like to get started?”
- The structured outcomes appear, but they are answers to a question the user never saw (likely because the question is being placed in the tool payload prompt, which the UI doesn’t render).

Required behavior:
- The assistant’s plain text message MUST include the question:
  “Great to meet you, <name>. How would you like to get started?”
- THEN (after that assistant message) the model may call append_structured_outcomes.
- Structured outcomes tool call MUST contain answers only:
  - No question text in options
  - Do not rely on payload.prompt to “ask” the question (payload.prompt can be empty or a short internal label, but must not be the only place the question exists)

Where to fix:
- Update the interview system prompt in server/routes.ts (search for “Second turn” / “How would you like to get started”).
- Update examples so they do NOT show legacy [[OPTIONS]] tokens anywhere.
- Add an explicit instruction: “Never put the user-facing question in tool payload. Always ask in assistant text.”

Acceptance criteria:
- In a real interview run: after name, user sees the question in assistant text, and the outcomes are clearly answers.
- Existing smoke tests still pass.

FINISHING STEPS
- Run npm run build and both smoke tests listed above (with raw output).
- Do a quick visual pass at 3 breakpoints and report.
