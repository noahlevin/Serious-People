0) Ground rules
- No pretending. Paste raw outputs.
- Create ONE shared layout component (AppShell) used across all pages.
- Be extremely conservative about CSS:
  - Prefer a small set of dedicated `.sp-*` classes in serious-people.css
  - Do NOT mix Tailwind utility soup + inline styles + custom CSS on the same container element.
  - Avoid overlapping classes with conflicting padding/margins.
- No visual redesign; keep spacing similar to current “good” pages.

1) Goal
Introduce a shared AppShell (Header + Footer + main container) and apply it to ALL routes so:
- The user menu is always in the upper-right on every page
- Header height is consistent and not “way too tall”
- Footer is consistent
- Main content never hides behind header
- We reduce per-page layout duplication (less drift)

2) Scope (ONLY)
- client/src/components/AppShell.tsx (new)
- client/src/styles/serious-people.css (add only shell/header/footer styles; avoid touching unrelated rules)
- client/src/App.tsx (wrap routes with AppShell)
- Any page components that currently render their own header/footer (edit only to remove duplicated wrappers once AppShell is applied)

3) Discovery (required BEFORE edits)
- grep -R "<header" client/src || true
- grep -R "<footer" client/src || true
- grep -R "sp-interview-header" client/src/styles/serious-people.css || true
- Provide a short list of pages that currently implement their own header/footer and what classnames they use.

4) Implementation requirements
A) AppShell structure
- <div className="sp-shell">
    <header className="sp-shell-header"> (logo left, <UserMenu/> right)
    <main className="sp-shell-main">{children}</main>
    <footer className="sp-shell-footer">...</footer>
  </div>

B) CSS: single-source header height + offsets
- Define header height once (CSS variable or explicit height)
- Ensure main top padding/margin matches header height
- If header is fixed, make it fixed everywhere; if not, make it static everywhere. Pick one and apply consistently.

C) Migration
- Wrap all routes in App.tsx with AppShell.
- Remove per-page headers/footers that would result in duplicates.
- Remove any per-page “padding-top” hacks that were compensating for fixed headers.

D) Safety against CSS conflicts
- When removing per-page header markup, also remove the associated conflicting classes if they are no longer used.
- Do NOT delete global CSS unless grep confirms it is unused.

5) Verification (paste raw outputs)
- npm run build
- grep -R "<header" client/src | head
- grep -R "<footer" client/src | head
- Manual sanity list (no screenshots needed):
  - / (landing)
  - /interview/start
  - /interview/prepare
  - /interview/chat
  - /module/1
  - /seriousplan
  Confirm: single header, menu present, content visible, footer present.

6) Acceptance criteria
- Every page has a single consistent header with UserMenu.
- Header height is consistent and not oversized.
- No double headers, no hidden content behind header.
- Build passes.
