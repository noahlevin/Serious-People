You are editing an existing Replit codebase. Follow these rules strictly.

## 0) Ground rules (no pretending)
- Do NOT say “tests passed” unless you actually ran the commands in the Replit shell and paste the raw output.
- Do NOT do wide refactors. Make the smallest change that achieves the goal.
- Prefer surgical edits.

## 1) Goal (one sentence)
GOAL: From /app/interview/start, clicking the primary CTA must navigate to /app/interview/prepare (not /app/interview/chat).

## 2) Scope boundaries
- You may edit ONLY these files (unless you ask first):
client/src/pages/interview-start.tsx
client/src/routes.ts (only if route constants are defined there)

## 3) Current behavior to preserve
- Preserve server-owned gating/state machine behavior.
- Preserve existing route paths (do not rename routes).

## 4) Implementation plan (small + explicit)
1) Find the InterviewStart CTA click handler in client/src/pages/interview-start.tsx.
2) Change navigation target to /interview/prepare (respecting router basename if present; typically navigate("/interview/prepare") is correct if BrowserRouter basename="/app").
3) Ensure no other navigation logic changed.

## 5) Exact edits
For each file you touch, produce:
- Path:
- Change type: surgical edit
- Diff-style summary

## 6) Mandatory verification (must run and paste output)
After edits, run these commands in the Replit shell and paste raw output:

### Build / type sanity
1) `npm test` if it exists, else say “no test script found”
2) `npm run build`

### Static verification
3) `grep -R "interview/chat" -n client/src/pages/interview-start.tsx || true`
4) `grep -R "interview/prepare" -n client/src/pages/interview-start.tsx`

### Minimal manual smoke (only 1 click)
5) Run `npm run dev` (or existing workflow) and:
- Visit /app/interview/start
- Click the CTA
Success = browser ends at /app/interview/prepare

## 7) Acceptance criteria (must be met)
- CTA from /app/interview/start routes to /app/interview/prepare every time.
- No other routes/pages changed.

## 8) Rollback note
- `git checkout -- client/src/pages/interview-start.tsx` (and routes.ts if touched)

Now execute the plan.
