# Serious People — SEO Taxonomy + Content Pillars (v1)

This file is the source of truth for the Serious People SEO engine.

It defines:
- The **pillar pages** (handwritten, highest quality)
- The **taxonomy** used to generate programmatic pages
- The **initial v1 batch** of pages to generate (25–50, high intent only)
- CTA rules and content module requirements so we don’t ship thin/duplicate pages
- Paid-ads readiness: `/lp/*` landing pages mapped to intent clusters

---

## 0) Routing + page types

We will ship three content surfaces (served as HTML, not SPA):

- **Guides** (indexable): `/guides/*`
- **Tools** (indexable): `/tools/*`
- **Landing pages for paid ads** (default noindex): `/lp/*`

Optional later:
- App mounted at `/app/*` (SPA)

---

## 1) Positioning constraints for content

Serious People is a structured, high-signal career decision session that produces concrete artifacts. Content should feel:
- pragmatic, specific, operator-grade
- not therapy, not vibes, not “manifest your future”
- frameworks + scripts + examples > generic advice

No fluff intros. Assume the reader is smart and stressed.

---

## 2) Pillar pages (8–12) — handwritten

These are the “hubs” we will link to constantly. Each pillar should be strong enough to rank on its own.

### Pillars list (v1)

1. `/guides/stay-or-go-framework`
   - Core decision framework + how to use it in 30–60 minutes

2. `/guides/burnout-vs-misfit-vs-bad-manager`
   - Diagnostic guide + next actions per diagnosis

3. `/guides/how-to-resign-without-burning-bridges`
   - The clean exit: timing, tone, scripts, common mistakes

4. `/guides/severance-negotiation-playbook`
   - Practical negotiation strategy + scripts + red lines

5. `/guides/executive-job-search-is-different`
   - How senior searches actually work; common traps; momentum plan

6. `/guides/how-to-explain-your-departure`
   - Narrative options (neutral, positive, planned transition) + examples

7. `/guides/what-to-do-in-the-first-14-days`
   - A tight plan to regain agency; decisions + actions + boundaries

8. `/guides/how-to-talk-to-your-boss-about-changing-your-role`
   - The internal pivot conversation; scripts; decision criteria

9. `/guides/how-to-evaluate-an-offer-like-an-adult`
   - Comp, scope, mandate, boss fit, decision rights

10. `/guides/when-to-use-a-coach`
   - Not “why coaching”; more like “what kind of help solves what problem”

Optional extra pillars if we have bandwidth:
11. `/guides/layoff-risk-plan`
12. `/guides/toxic-boss-survival-or-exit`

---

## 3) Tools (conversion + link magnets)

Tools should be genuinely useful and work without login.

### Tools list (v1)

1. `/tools/stay-or-go-worksheet`
   - Inputs → score + recommended direction + next steps
   - Export: copyable summary

2. `/tools/severance-runway-calculator`
   - Inputs → runway, risk flags, decision considerations
   - Export: copyable summary

Nice-to-have (v2):
- `/tools/exit-message-generator` (resignation + all-hands variants)
- `/tools/narrative-builder` (LinkedIn “about” + interview story outline)
- `/tools/role-mandate-checklist` (boss fit + decision rights)

---

## 4) Taxonomy (for programmatic pages)

We generate pages from a controlled set of dimensions. We intentionally keep this small in v1.

### 4.1 Dimensions

#### Roles (`role`)
- vp-product
- director-product
- product-manager
- director-engineering
- engineering-manager
- ops-leader
- gm
- founder

#### Situations (`situation`)
- stay-or-go
- burnout
- bad-manager
- toxic-culture
- severance
- internal-pivot
- job-search
- offer-evaluation
- resignation
- layoff-risk

#### Goals (`goal`)
- decide
- negotiate
- narrate
- plan
- execute

#### Seniority (`seniority`)
- mid
- senior
- exec

> Note: seniority is used mostly to vary examples + “what matters” sections. We don’t need a separate URL dimension for it in v1 unless we want it.

### 4.2 URL scheme (v1)

We’ll support two programmatic patterns:

A) Situation-first (broad intent):
- `/situations/{situation}`
- `/situations/{situation}/{goal}`

B) Role + situation (high-intent, better conversion):
- `/roles/{role}/situations/{situation}`
- `/roles/{role}/situations/{situation}/{goal}`

We should start by generating only pattern B for the highest intent combinations.

---

## 5) CTA rules (SEO now + paid later)

Each page gets **one primary CTA**. Secondary links are internal only.

### CTA types
- `cta_session`: Start the Serious People session (or intro flow)
- `cta_tool`: Use a tool (worksheet/calculator)
- `cta_email`: Optional email capture (only where it fits; avoid gating)

### Default CTA mapping
- If `situation` in (stay-or-go, burnout, bad-manager, toxic-culture, internal-pivot): **cta_session**
- If `situation` in (severance, offer-evaluation): **cta_tool** first, then session as internal link
- If `situation` in (job-search, resignation, layoff-risk): **cta_session** (with a “first 14 days” internal link)

### Paid landing pages (`/lp/*`)
- Default `noindex`
- 1:1 message match to ad group (see section 10)

---

## 6) Content module requirements (to avoid thin pages)

Every indexable page must contain these modules (minimum):

1) **Framework** (“how to think about it”)
2) **Common mistakes** (situation-specific, role-tinted)
3) **Example vignette** (concrete scenario; anonymized)
4) **What you’ll walk away with** (tie to artifacts)
5) **CTA block** (single primary)
6) **Related links** (6–10 internal links)

### Required variation (important)
For each situation, we need at least:
- 2 variants of the framework module
- 2 variants of mistakes module
- 2 variants of vignettes per role cluster (product/eng/ops/executive)

If a generated page reuses too much identical text, ship it with `noindex` until it passes the quality gate.

---

## 7) “Artifacts” language (what we promise)

We should describe outputs consistently. Suggested language:

- Decision snapshot (what’s true, what’s not, what matters)
- Fork recommendation (stay vs go vs pivot, with rationale)
- Risk map (what could go wrong, how to mitigate)
- Conversation scripts (boss / partner / recruiter)
- Action plan (14 days + 30 days)
- Narrative outline (LinkedIn + interview story)

---

## 8) Initial programmatic batch (v1) — 50 pages

We will generate these first. They skew toward high intent + roles that map to your audience.

### 8.1 Role + situation pages (core)

1. `/roles/vp-product/situations/stay-or-go`
2. `/roles/vp-product/situations/burnout`
3. `/roles/vp-product/situations/bad-manager`
4. `/roles/vp-product/situations/toxic-culture`
5. `/roles/vp-product/situations/severance`
6. `/roles/vp-product/situations/internal-pivot`
7. `/roles/vp-product/situations/job-search`
8. `/roles/vp-product/situations/offer-evaluation`
9. `/roles/vp-product/situations/resignation`
10. `/roles/vp-product/situations/layoff-risk`

11. `/roles/director-product/situations/stay-or-go`
12. `/roles/director-product/situations/burnout`
13. `/roles/director-product/situations/bad-manager`
14. `/roles/director-product/situations/toxic-culture`
15. `/roles/director-product/situations/severance`
16. `/roles/director-product/situations/internal-pivot`
17. `/roles/director-product/situations/job-search`
18. `/roles/director-product/situations/offer-evaluation`
19. `/roles/director-product/situations/resignation`
20. `/roles/director-product/situations/layoff-risk`

21. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/stay-or-go`
22. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/burnout`
23. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/bad-manager`
24. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/toxic-culture`
25. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/severance`
26. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/internal-pivot`
27. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/job-search`
28. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/offer-evaluation`
29. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/resignation`
30. `/roles/director-engineering/situations/layoff-risk`

31. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/stay-or-go`
32. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/burnout`
33. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/bad-manager`
34. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/toxic-culture`
35. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/internal-pivot`
36. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/job-search`
37. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/offer-evaluation`
38. `/roles/engineering-manager/situations/resignation`

39. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/stay-or-go`
40. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/burnout`
41. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/bad-manager`
42. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/toxic-culture`
43. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/internal-pivot`
44. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/job-search`
45. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/offer-evaluation`
46. `/roles/ops-leader/situations/resignation`

47. `/roles/founder/situations/burnout`
48. `/roles/founder/situations/stay-or-go`
49. `/roles/founder/situations/toxic-culture`
50. `/roles/founder/situations/internal-pivot`

Notes:
- We intentionally include fewer founder pages in v1 (different intent; risk of mismatched promise).
- Severance for eng mgr/ops is real, but we’re prioritizing seniority where severance negotiation is more common.

### 8.2 Optional “goal” variants (v1.1)
After these 50 are stable, add goal pages for top combos:
- `.../stay-or-go/decide`
- `.../severance/negotiate`
- `.../resignation/narrate`
- `.../job-search/plan`

Only ship goal variants if the modules clearly diverge.

---

## 9) Internal linking rules

Each generated page should link to:
- 1–2 relevant **pillars**
- 1 relevant **tool**
- 3–6 adjacent generated pages:
  - same role, adjacent situations
  - same situation, adjacent roles (limit this to avoid link spam)
- `/guides/what-to-do-in-the-first-14-days` frequently (it’s a strong cross-cutting hub)

Avoid giant tag clouds.

---

## 10) Paid ads readiness: initial `/lp/*` set (noindex by default)

These are tightly scoped, message-matched pages intended for future search ads.

1. `/lp/stay-or-go-session`
2. `/lp/burnout-decision-session`
3. `/lp/severance-negotiation`
4. `/lp/resignation-script`
5. `/lp/executive-job-search-plan`
6. `/lp/internal-pivot-conversation`

Rules:
- Minimal nav
- One primary CTA
- Tight copy; no long educational sections
- Keep them `noindex` unless we deliberately want them indexed

---

## 11) Machine-readable taxonomy (canonical)

The SEO engine should commit a canonical file at:
- `/seo/taxonomy/taxonomy.json`

Suggested structure:

```json
{
  "roles": [
    {"key":"vp-product","label":"VP Product"},
    {"key":"director-product","label":"Director of Product"},
    {"key":"product-manager","label":"Product Manager"},
    {"key":"director-engineering","label":"Director of Engineering"},
    {"key":"engineering-manager","label":"Engineering Manager"},
    {"key":"ops-leader","label":"Operations Leader"},
    {"key":"gm","label":"General Manager"},
    {"key":"founder","label":"Founder"}
  ],
  "situations": [
    {"key":"stay-or-go","label":"Stay or go"},
    {"key":"burnout","label":"Burnout"},
    {"key":"bad-manager","label":"Bad manager"},
    {"key":"toxic-culture","label":"Toxic culture"},
    {"key":"severance","label":"Severance"},
    {"key":"internal-pivot","label":"Internal pivot"},
    {"key":"job-search","label":"Job search"},
    {"key":"offer-evaluation","label":"Offer evaluation"},
    {"key":"resignation","label":"Resignation"},
    {"key":"layoff-risk","label":"Layoff risk"}
  ],
  "goals": [
    {"key":"decide","label":"Decide"},
    {"key":"negotiate","label":"Negotiate"},
    {"key":"narrate","label":"Narrate"},
    {"key":"plan","label":"Plan"},
    {"key":"execute","label":"Execute"}
  ],
  "ctaRules": {
    "stay-or-go":"cta_session",
    "burnout":"cta_session",
    "bad-manager":"cta_session",
    "toxic-culture":"cta_session",
    "internal-pivot":"cta_session",
    "job-search":"cta_session",
    "resignation":"cta_session",
    "layoff-risk":"cta_session",
    "severance":"cta_tool",
    "offer-evaluation":"cta_tool"
  }
}
The initial page list should also be committed:

/seo/taxonomy/pages.json (array of route specs, including title templates and CTA type)

12) Title + description templates (starter)
We should generate titles that are varied but controlled.

Title patterns
{Situation} for {Role}: a practical framework

How to handle {Situation} as a {Role}

{Role} guide to {Situation}: decisions, scripts, next steps

Meta description patterns
“A no-fluff guide to {situation} for {role}—framework, common mistakes, examples, and scripts. Includes a 14-day plan and a clear next step.”

Keep it human. Avoid keyword stuffing.

13) Indexing + quality gate policy
Default:

Pillars: index

Tools: index

Programmatic: index only if it passes quality gate

LP pages: noindex

Quality gate minimums for indexable programmatic pages:

Must include all required modules (section 6)

Must exceed minimum unique content threshold

Must not exceed similarity threshold vs closest neighbors

If it fails, render normally but add:

<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow" />

14) Editorial voice guardrails
Make recommendations only when you can explain them

Use concrete examples (vignettes) that feel real

Favor scripts over slogans

Be honest about tradeoffs: “If you do X, you’re betting on Y”

No “follow your passion” energy

15) Next edits (when we learn from real traffic)
After Search Console shows impressions:

Expand the situations that get traction

Add goal-variant pages only where they truly diverge

Improve top 5 pages with deeper examples and better scripts

Prune low-quality / redundant pages aggressively
