0) Ground rules (no pretending)
- Do NOT claim tests passed unless you ran the commands and pasted raw output.
- Make the smallest possible changes. No refactors. Do NOT introduce a new shared Header/AppShell component in this batch.
- ONLY edit the files listed in Scope. If you think you need another file, stop and explain why.

1) Goal
Fix interview header UX + add the existing UserMenu (name/logout) to the upper-right on /interview/start, /interview/prepare, /interview/chat; remove “Save and Exit”; remove “Step 1 of 4”; remove “encrypted” wording; ensure logout redirects to “/” from anywhere.

2) Scope boundaries (ONLY these files)
- client/src/lovable/pages/Interview.tsx
- client/src/lovable/pages/Prepare.tsx
- client/src/lovable/pages/InterviewChat.tsx
- client/src/components/UserMenu.tsx
- (Do NOT touch routing wrappers or App.tsx in this batch unless absolutely necessary.)

3) Exact changes required (surgical)
A) Header height
- Make the header on Interview/Prepare/InterviewChat visually shorter.
- Keep the existing brand/wordmark on the left.
- Use a consistent layout approach across these 3 pages: left brand, right user menu.

B) Remove “Step 1 of 4”
- On Interview.tsx remove that copy entirely.

C) Add UserMenu to the 3 interview pages
- Import and render <UserMenu /> in the upper-right of each header.
- This must be the existing component at client/src/components/UserMenu.tsx.

D) Remove “Save and Exit”
- On InterviewChat.tsx remove the “Save and Exit” button and any unused handler/imports.

E) Remove “encrypted” references
- Replace any “encrypted” wording in these edited files with accurate language (“confidential” is OK).

F) Logout redirect fix
- In UserMenu.tsx, ensure logout navigates to "/" using react-router-dom (not wouter). The goal is: logging out from /module/1 does a hard redirect to landing behaviorally (SPA nav is fine, but must land at "/").
- Do not otherwise change auth logic.

4) Verification (paste raw output)
- npm run build
- grep -R "Save and Exit" client/src || true
- grep -R "Step 1 of 4" client/src || true
- grep -R "encrypted" client/src || true
- grep -R "from \"wouter\"" client/src/components/UserMenu.tsx || true

5) Acceptance criteria
- /interview/start header is shorter and does NOT show “Step 1 of 4”
- /interview/prepare header is shorter and shows UserMenu on the right when logged in
- /interview/chat header is shorter, shows UserMenu on the right, and does NOT show “Save and Exit”
- After logout (including from /module/1), user ends up at "/"
- Build succeeds

6) Deliverables
- Diff summary per file (what changed)
- Raw outputs for verification commands
