0) Ground rules
- No pretending. Paste raw outputs.
- Fix regressions with minimal changes.
- Avoid CSS conflicts: don’t layer tailwind + inline + custom on the same element.

1) Goals
A) Fix header vertical alignment at tablet/desktop widths (logo + UserMenu should be vertically centered and aligned).
B) Make ScrollToTop not visibly scroll after load; page should start at top on navigation.
C) Logout must always go to the marketing landing page at "/" (not /app/*, not /interview/start).
D) Auth guard for protected SPA routes should also send unauth users to "/" via hard redirect (not Navigate within SPA).

2) Scope (ONLY)
- client/src/App.tsx
- client/src/components/AppShell.tsx
- client/src/components/UserMenu.tsx
- client/src/styles/serious-people.css

3) Implementation details

A) Header alignment (AppShell + CSS)
- Ensure header uses a single class for sizing/alignment (e.g. .sp-shell-header)
- In CSS:
  - set a clear min-height (e.g. 48px/56px) and vertical padding if needed
  - ensure header inner container is display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:space-between
- Ensure logo element has sane line-height (avoid baseline drift).
- Ensure UserMenu trigger/button is also display:flex; align-items:center so it centers vertically with the logo.

B) ScrollToTop jank
- In App.tsx, change ScrollToTop to useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect, so it runs before paint.
- Keep dependency on pathname only.
- Optional (if needed): set `history.scrollRestoration = "manual"` once at app start.

C) Logout to landing page
- In UserMenu logout handler:
  - after logout completes, do `window.location.replace("/")` (NOT react-router navigate).
- In RequireAuth (or whatever wrapper):
  - if unauthenticated, do a hard redirect:
    - `window.location.replace("/")`
    - return null (or a tiny placeholder) to avoid rendering.

4) Visual verification (required)
Check at ~390px, ~768px, ~1200px+:
- Header: logo and menu vertically aligned/centered
- Navigate from a scrolled page to another: landing at top without visible scroll animation
- Logout from /app/interview/chat: ends at marketing landing "/" (not /app/*)

5) Verification (paste raw outputs)
- npm run build
- DEV_FAST=1 node scripts/smoke-interview-chat.mjs
- node scripts/smoke-module-chat.mjs

6) Acceptance criteria
- Header alignment fixed on tablet/desktop.
- No visible scroll-to-top animation on load/navigation.
- Logout reliably returns to "/" via hard redirect.
- Unauthed access to protected SPA routes also hard redirects to "/".
- Build + smokes pass.
