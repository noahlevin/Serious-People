### BRAND QUOTE (Logan Roy)

*[Keep existing Logan Roy quote block from current site]*

### PROBLEM / USE CASES

**Section headline:**
This is for the decisions that keep you up at night.

**Scenarios:**

1. You're on the fence about quitting and don't want to make a decision you'll regret.

2. Your role has drifted into something you never signed up for. You need to renegotiate—or leave.

3. You're stuck in a bad dynamic with your boss and can't tell if it's fixable.

4. You're about to have a hard conversation with your partner about money, risk, and timing.

5. You've written a dozen draft emails in your head. None of them feel right.

---

### HOW IT WORKS

**Section headline:**
Here's what happens.

**Step 1 — Free coaching interview (5–10 min)**
You answer the questions a good career coach would ask: What's actually happening? What have you tried? What's at stake? By the end, you'll see a plain-language coaching plan tailored to your situation. Review it, adjust it, then decide if you want to continue.

**Step 2 — Guided working session (~30 min)**
Your coach walks you through three modules. First, you go deep on what's really going on—the stuff you haven't fully articulated, even to yourself. Then you map your options, constraints, and trade-offs. Finally, you turn your thinking into a concrete plan with real next steps.

**Step 3 — Your Serious Plan (instant)**
You leave with a set of documents you can actually use. Decision summary. Conversation scripts. A 30–90 day action plan. A risk map for what could go wrong. No inspirational posters. No vague frameworks. Just clear language you can copy into an email tonight.

---

### WHAT'S IN YOUR SERIOUS PLAN

**Section headline:**
What you actually get.

**Intro paragraph:**
Every Serious Plan is different because every situation is different. But yours will include artifacts like these:

**Artifact 1: Decision Snapshot**
A one-page summary of your situation, your options, and the trade-offs. This is the map you keep coming back to when you're second-guessing yourself at 2am.

**Artifact 2: Conversation Scripts**
Word-for-word scripts for the conversations that matter most:
- A 2–3 minute script for your manager or exec—clear, honest, non-destructive
- A script for your partner about money, risk, and timelines
- Scripts for other stakeholders (HR, mentors, peers) if your situation calls for them

**Artifact 3: Action Plan (30–90 days)**
Concrete next moves with timing. What to try first. What to document. How to know if things are actually improving. When to draw a line.

**Artifact 4: Risk Map**
A candid look at what could go wrong—whether you stay, reshape the role, or leave. Includes "if X happens, say Y" playbooks so you're not improvising when it counts.

**Artifact 5: Resources & Prompts**
Curated exercises and reflection prompts based on your exact situation. Not a generic reading list.

---

### SAMPLE SCRIPT PREVIEW

**Section headline:**
Here's the kind of thing you'll get.

**Context line:**
From an actual Serious Plan (details changed):

**Sample script excerpt:**
> **If your manager says:** "We really need you to stay through Q2 for this launch."
>
> **You say:** "I understand the timing is hard. I want to be straightforward with you: I've decided to move on, and my last day will be [date]. I'm committed to making the transition as smooth as possible—let's talk about what handoff would look like."

**Closing line:**
Every script is tuned to your situation, your relationship, and your goals. You're not adapting generic templates—you're getting language that sounds like you on your best day.

---

### WHY THIS INSTEAD OF...

**Section headline:**
Why people pay for this instead of just thinking it through.

**Comparison 1: vs. Journaling or venting to friends**
Your friends will validate you. Journaling helps you process. Neither will give you a script for Monday's meeting or a 90-day plan. Serious People turns feelings into a document you can act on.

**Comparison 2: vs. Generic AI (ChatGPT, etc.)**
Most AI tools act like polite yes-men—they validate your first idea and dress it up in nicer words. Serious People follows a structured coaching curriculum. It will push back on fuzzy thinking, ask harder questions, and sometimes disagree with you. That's what makes the output useful.

**Comparison 3: vs. A human career coach**
A good coach costs $200–500/hour and takes weeks to book. Serious People costs [PRICE] and works on your schedule. It's not a replacement for deep, ongoing coaching—but it's a powerful starting point. If you hire a human coach later, hand them your Serious Plan and skip the first three sessions of "so tell me what's going on."

**Comparison 4: vs. Doing nothing**
You already know how that goes. The situation festers. You make a reactive decision when you're fed up instead of a strategic one when you're clear. Serious People is the forcing function that gets you unstuck.

---

### WHO THIS IS FOR

**Section headline:**
This is for people who are ready to decide.

**Body text:**
If you're mid-career or senior, your choices affect real money and real people, and you want to walk away with a plan—not just reassurance—this will help.

If you're looking for therapy, legal advice, or someone to make the decision for you, this isn't that. If you're not planning to actually have the conversations this prepares you for, save your money.

---

### FAQ

**Section headline:**
Questions people ask before getting serious.

**Q1: Is this really "just AI"?**
Serious People is AI-powered, but it's not a generic chatbot. It uses large language models guided by a specific coaching philosophy: ask hard questions, reflect back what it hears, push toward clear decisions. It won't pretend to be human, but it will behave like an experienced, no-nonsense coach—one that knows when to slow you down and when to back your instincts.

**Q2: Will my information be private?**
Yes. Your interview and plan are stored securely and used only to generate your Serious Plan. We don't sell or share your stories with anyone.

**Q3: How long does this take?**
Most people finish the free interview in 5–10 minutes. The full coaching session takes about 30 minutes. Your Serious Plan is generated within a few minutes after that.

**Q4: Does this replace working with a human coach?**
It doesn't have to. Serious People is a great first step—or a complement to human coaching. You can start right now, on your own schedule, without committing to a multi-session package. If you decide to work with a coach later, your Serious Plan becomes a powerful starting brief.

## PART 2: REPLIT AGENT PROMPT

```
# Serious People Landing Page — Build Prompt

## Overview

Build a landing page for Serious People (seriouspeople.app), an AI-powered career coaching product. The page should feel premium, direct, and confident—not salesy or startup-y. Think: the landing page equivalent of a well-dressed person who doesn't need to tell you they're important.

## Brand & Tone

**Voice:** Direct, warm, slightly dry. Like a trusted advisor who respects your time. No exclamation points. No "unlock your potential" energy. No emoji.

**Aesthetic:** Clean, typographically confident, lots of whitespace. Dark mode default (current site uses dark). Subtle, purposeful motion—nothing that feels like a template.

**References for feel:**
- Linear.app (clarity, confidence, motion)
- Superhuman (premium, focused)
- Calm.com (breathing room, not cluttered)

Avoid:
- Gradient blobs
- Stock photos of people in meetings
- Testimonial carousels
- "As seen in" logo bars
- Anything that looks like a Webflow template from 2021

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section
- Large headline, centered or left-aligned
- Subhead that establishes the emotional context (the "you've drafted the resignation email three times" hook)
- Primary CTA button (high contrast, clear)
- Secondary text link for returning users
- Reassurance line in smaller text below CTAs

**Animation:** Subtle fade-in on load. Headline can have a slight staggered reveal (word by word or line by line) but keep it fast—under 800ms total.

### 2. Brand Quote Block
- Pull in the existing Logan Roy quote from the current site
- Style as a standout blockquote—maybe a subtle background shift or left border
- Keep it visually distinct but not overwhelming

### 3. Problem / Use Cases Section
- Section headline
- 5 scenario bullets
- These should feel like a checklist of recognition ("oh, that's me")

**Layout:** Could be a simple vertical list, or a 2-column layout on desktop. Don't over-design—the copy does the work.

**Animation:** Optional subtle stagger as items enter viewport.

### 4. How It Works Section
- 3 steps with headlines and body text
- Numbered or with subtle step indicators
- Clear visual progression

**Layout:** Horizontal 3-column on desktop, vertical stack on mobile. Consider a subtle connecting line or timeline element.

**Animation:** Steps can animate in sequence on scroll.

### 5. What's In Your Serious Plan Section
- Intro paragraph
- 5 artifact cards/blocks (Decision Snapshot, Scripts, Action Plan, Risk Map, Resources)

**Layout:** Cards or accordion. If cards, 2-3 column grid on desktop. Each card should have a clear title and 2-3 sentence description.

**Animation:** Cards can have subtle hover states (slight lift, border glow, or background shift).

### 6. Sample Script Preview Section
- This is a "proof" section—show, don't just tell
- Display an actual script excerpt in a styled blockquote or code-block-style container
- Context line above, closing line below

**Layout:** Centered, with generous padding. The script itself should feel like a document preview.

**Animation:** Could have a subtle typewriter effect on the script text, but only if it's fast and skippable.

**IMPORTANT — Generating sample content:**
You have access to the LLM coach and chat history. Generate 2-3 realistic sample script excerpts based on actual coaching patterns. These should feel specific and useful—not generic. Examples:
- A script for telling your manager you're leaving
- A script for asking for a raise/scope change
- A script for talking to a partner about job risk
Make them feel real. Change identifying details but keep the texture.

### 7. Why This Instead Of... Section
- 4 comparison blocks (vs. journaling, vs. ChatGPT, vs. human coach, vs. doing nothing)
- Each should be short and punchy—2-3 sentences max

**Layout:** Vertical stack or 2x2 grid. Simple, not over-designed.

### 8. Who This Is For Section
- Short section—just a headline and 2 paragraphs
- First paragraph: who it's for
- Second paragraph: who it's not for

**Layout:** Centered text, generous margins.

### 9. FAQ Section
- 4 questions with expandable answers
- Accordion or toggle pattern

**Animation:** Smooth expand/collapse. Consider a subtle rotation on the toggle icon.

### 10. Final CTA Section
- Headline
- Short body text
- Primary CTA button
- Secondary text link (email contact)

**Layout:** Centered, lots of breathing room above and below. This is the "okay, you've scrolled this far, here's your moment" section.

## Technical Specs

**Framework:** Use whatever's already set up in this Replit project, or default to Next.js + Tailwind.

**Responsive:** Mobile-first. Test at 375px, 768px, 1280px.

**Performance:** 
- Lazy load anything below the fold
- Keep animations CSS-based where possible (no heavy JS animation libraries unless necessary)
- Target < 2s load time on 3G

**Accessibility:**
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 for hero, h2 for sections, h3 for sub-items)
- All interactive elements keyboard-accessible
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- Reduced motion media query respected for animations

## Colors & Typography

Pull from the existing site's design system if one exists. If not:

**Colors (dark mode default):**
- Background: Near-black (#0a0a0a or similar)
- Primary text: Off-white (#f5f5f5)
- Secondary text: Muted gray (#888)
- Accent: A single accent color for CTAs and links—something confident but not flashy. Consider a warm amber/gold or a sharp teal.
- Cards/containers: Slightly lighter than background (#141414)

**Typography:**
- Headline font: Something with presence. Inter, Söhne, or a similar geometric sans.
- Body font: Same family or a highly readable sans-serif
- Monospace for any code/script previews

**Sizing:**
- Hero headline: Large (48-72px on desktop)
- Section headlines: Medium-large (32-40px)
- Body text: Comfortable reading size (18-20px)
- Generous line-height (1.5-1.7 for body)

## Animations & Micro-interactions

**General principles:**
- Animations should feel purposeful, not decorative
- Fast entrances (200-400ms), slightly slower exits
- Ease-out curves for entrances, ease-in-out for hovers
- Nothing should animate on every scroll—trigger once when entering viewport

**Specific animations:**
- Hero text: Staggered fade-up on load
- Section headlines: Subtle fade-up on scroll
- Cards: Slight lift on hover (transform: translateY(-2px))
- Buttons: Background color transition on hover (150ms)
- Accordions: Smooth height transition (300ms)
- Page transitions (if multi-page): Crossfade

**What to avoid:**
- Parallax scrolling
- Floating elements that move as you scroll
- Animations that replay every time you scroll past
- Anything that feels "whimsical" or "playful"

## Content to Generate

Using the LLM coach and chat history, generate the following sample content for inclusion on the page:

1. **2-3 Sample Script Excerpts**
   - Pull patterns from actual coaching conversations
   - Create realistic manager/exec conversation scripts
   - Create a partner/spouse conversation script
   - Make them specific enough to feel real, generic enough to not be identifying
   - Each should be 3-5 exchanges (if/then format or short dialogue)

2. **Sample Decision Snapshot Preview** (optional)
   - A visual preview of what a Decision Snapshot looks like
   - Can be a blurred/partially visible document image or a structured text preview

## Files to Create/Modify

Based on the existing project structure, you'll likely need to:
- Create or modify the main landing page component
- Create section components for each major section
- Add/update styles (Tailwind classes or CSS modules)
- Add any necessary animation utilities
- Update the CTA buttons to link to the existing auth/interview flow

## Final Checklist

Before marking complete:
- [ ] All sections render correctly on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] CTAs link to correct destinations
- [ ] Animations respect reduced-motion preferences
- [ ] Page loads quickly (check Lighthouse)
- [ ] Dark mode looks intentional, not inverted
- [ ] Copy matches the content document exactly
- [ ] Sample scripts feel authentic and useful
- [ ] No placeholder text or images remain
- [ ] Logan Roy quote block is preserved from current site
