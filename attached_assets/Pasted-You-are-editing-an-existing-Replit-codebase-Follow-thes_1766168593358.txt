You are editing an existing Replit codebase. Follow these rules strictly.

0) Ground rules (no pretending)

Do NOT say “tests passed” unless you actually ran the commands in the Replit shell and paste the raw output.

Do NOT do wide refactors. Make the smallest change that achieves the goal.

This is a DISCOVERY-ONLY pass: do NOT modify files.

1) Goal (one sentence)

GOAL: Identify the exact client file paths for the Modules pages and the Interview/Chat page (and the shared layout/components they use), so we can redesign Modules to match the interview/chat regime with minimal edits.

2) Scope boundaries

Do NOT edit any files.

You may run read-only shell commands (rg/ls/cat).

3) What to discover and output

A) Find the Modules routes (list + detail):

Identify the React route definitions for modules (e.g. paths containing “/modules”).

Output:

route path(s)

component name(s)

file path(s)

B) Find the Interview/Chat route/page that represents the “interview/chat regime”:

Identify the route path(s) and page component file.

Output:

route path(s)

component name(s)

file path(s)

C) Find the shared UI components/layout used by the Interview/Chat page:

List the top 3–8 imported components that define the chat look/structure (page shell, message list, cards, typography wrappers).

Output:

component names

file paths

4) Commands to run (must paste raw output)

Run these in the Replit shell and paste outputs:

ls

ls client || true

ls server || true

rg -n "modules" client src server || true

rg -n "/modules|path:.*modules|route.*modules" client/src || true

rg -n "interview|chat|conversation" client/src/lovable client/src || true

Once you find the route file(s), sed -n '1,220p' <PATH_TO_ROUTE_FILE> (adjust range as needed)

For the identified chat page file, sed -n '1,260p' <PATH_TO_CHAT_PAGE_FILE>

5) Deliverable format

Return a short report:

Modules routes:

<route> -> <Component> (<file path>)

Interview/Chat routes:

<route> -> <Component> (<file path>)

Shared components to reuse:

<Component> (<file path>) — why it matters

Proposed “smallest edit set”:

list the 2–5 files we’ll likely edit to make Modules match Chat

Stop there. Do NOT implement.
