Step 1 — Find the Lovable shell to mimic

In the repo, locate where the Lovable “chrome” lives (header/nav/footer/layout). Run:

grep -R --line-number "function Header\|const Header\|<header\|TopNav\|Navbar\|AppShell\|Layout" client/src | head -n 50
grep -R --line-number "Serious People" client/src/lovable client/src/pages | head -n 50


Open the likely candidates and identify:

header markup (logo + nav + CTA)

footer markup (simple links + copyright)

container widths / padding / sticky behavior

If there isn’t a single component, just grab the markup from the Lovable landing page (client/src/lovable/pages/Index.tsx or similar) and treat that as the “shell.”

Step 2 — Create EJS partials

Create:

seo/templates/partials/header.ejs

seo/templates/partials/footer.ejs

These should be pure HTML with no Tailwind classes (or if you keep Tailwind-ish classnames, you must also ensure the SEO pages load a stylesheet that defines them — easiest is pure CSS).

Step 3 — Replace header/footer in both templates

Update both:

seo/templates/layout.ejs

seo/templates/landing.ejs

to use the partials:

<%- include("partials/header", { active: typeof active !== "undefined" ? active : "" }) %>
...
<%- include("partials/footer") %>


This ensures:

all SEO pages share the same chrome

landing page shares the same chrome (so it won’t keep drifting)

Step 4 — Put the Lovable-like shell CSS in one place

Do not keep massive inline CSS in both templates long-term.

Put shell CSS into /seo.css (the file you’re already serving) under a section like:

/* --- Lovable-ish SEO Shell --- */
.sp-shell { ... }
.sp-topbar { ... }
.sp-nav { ... }
.sp-btn { ... }
...


And then make both templates use those classes.

Step 5 — Kill the “old landing” look

Right now landing.ejs is basically its own bespoke site. You have two choices:

Option A (faster): keep landing content, but:

remove/trim the huge inline <style> block

use the shared shell + shared CSS + token variables

Option B (truer match): port the Lovable landing content/sections from the SPA page into EJS (same headings, same order, same CTA copy), then keep it tokenized.

If your goal is “root looks like Lovable,” you almost certainly want Option B.

Step 6 — Definition of done checks

/ shows the new Lovable-ish header/footer (and not the old “newspaper” header)

/guides, /resources, /roles, calculator all show the same header/footer

all “Start Session” links go to /app/interview/start

all “Log in” links go to /app/login
