Replit Agent Prompt: Phased SEO Build Plan (Serious People)
Non-negotiables

Do not break the existing SPA at / in early phases.

Use a single Replit deployment and same-domain routing.

All SEO pages must be server-served HTML (static pre-render is fine), not SPA-only.

Keep /app optional until later; do not require migrating users to /app until we choose to flip.

Any programmatic pages must pass a “quality gate” (minimum content, not near-duplicate) before being indexable.

Phase 0 — Repo prep + taxonomy file (no behavior changes)
Goal

Create the scaffolding for an SEO surface and the taxonomy that will drive programmatic pages.

Tasks

0.1) Create the markdown file /docs/seo_taxonomy_and_pillars.md.
It must include:

The 8–12 “pillar” pages (handwritten) with proposed slugs

The taxonomy dimensions (role, situation, goal, seniority) with allowed values

A list of the first 25–50 programmatic pages to generate first (highest intent only)

A mapping from each taxonomy branch to a recommended CTA type (session, tool, email capture)

0.2) Add a machine-readable version of that taxonomy alongside it (Agent can derive from the markdown but should commit a canonical data file), e.g.:

/seo/taxonomy/taxonomy.json

/seo/taxonomy/pages.json (the initial “seed” list of pages)

0.3) Add a placeholder /seo/README.md describing how the SEO system works and how to reuse it for other products.

Definition of done

Repo contains /docs/seo_taxonomy_and_pillars.md plus a canonical JSON taxonomy file.

No routing or build behavior changed.

Phase 1 — Stand up SEO site build (Astro recommended) + serve one page on /guides/*
Goal

Prove the core architecture: Express serves real HTML for a marketing route, while the SPA continues owning /.

Implementation approach (recommended)

Use Astro for the SEO surface because it’s HTML-first, fast, and makes programmatic generation easy.

Tasks

1.1) Create a new folder /seo with an Astro project configured to output a static build to /seo/dist.
1.2) Implement a single guide page that matches a pillar in the taxonomy markdown, for example:

/guides/stay-or-go (or whatever you specify in the taxonomy file)

1.3) Wire Express to serve that HTML at the same domain:

Requests to /guides/* should return the built HTML from seo/dist

All other routes remain unchanged (SPA still served for / and other app routes)

1.4) Add a shared header/footer style that matches your current brand minimally (doesn’t need to be perfect yet). Include one obvious CTA linking to the app (for now, it can link to /).

1.5) Add basic SEO essentials for that single page:

<title>, meta description, canonical

OpenGraph tags

Basic JSON-LD Article schema (optional but nice)

Definition of done

Visiting https://seriouspeople.app/guides/<slug> returns real HTML (view-source shows content).

/ behavior is identical to today.

Only one guide exists and it looks acceptable.

Phase 2 — Expand to pillars + SEO plumbing (robots, sitemap, canonical, 404)
Goal

Create a proper crawlable marketing surface that you can scale safely.

Tasks

2.1) Implement the 8–12 pillar pages defined in /docs/seo_taxonomy_and_pillars.md as Astro routes under /guides/*.
2.2) Add /robots.txt with conservative rules:

Allow indexing of /guides/* and /tools/*

Disallow indexing of obvious app/private paths (anything with auth, payments, user content)
2.3) Add /sitemap.xml generation for:

/guides/* pillar pages

Later we’ll add programmatic pages; for now keep it tight

2.4) Implement:

/guides index page listing pillars

404 page for missing guides

2.5) Add internal linking:

Each pillar links to 2–4 other relevant pillars (hard-coded at first; later auto-generated from taxonomy)

Definition of done

Pillars exist and are linked via an index page.

robots + sitemap exist and validate.

Google Search Console can be pointed at the domain without obvious issues.

Phase 3 — Build the “SEO engine” (taxonomy-driven programmatic pages with a quality gate)
Goal

Generate programmatic SEO pages from taxonomy while avoiding thin/duplicate content.

Core concept

A “page composer” renders each page from modules, and the modules vary based on role/situation/goal so pages aren’t clones.

Tasks

3.1) Create a deterministic “page composer” in /seo/src/lib/pageComposer.ts that takes a page spec and renders:

Hero: intent-matched headline + subhead

Framework section: “how to think about this”

Mistakes section: role/situation-specific

One short vignette: realistic example

“What you’ll walk away with”: tie to Serious People outputs/artifacts

CTA: one primary CTA only

Related links: 6–10 internal links (generated)

3.2) Create a content module library keyed by taxonomy:

/seo/src/content/modules/...

Each module must have at least 2 variants (so different pages don’t share identical paragraphs)

3.3) Generate the initial 25–50 programmatic pages listed in your taxonomy markdown:

/roles/:role/...

/situations/:situation/...

or combined route /roles/:role/situations/:situation/goals/:goal (pick one scheme and stick to it)

3.4) Implement a quality gate:

If a page fails checks, render it but ship it with noindex meta
Checks should include:

Minimum unique content length

Duplication similarity check vs nearest neighbors (simple hashing / shingling is fine)

Required modules present

3.5) Extend sitemap generation:

Include only indexable pages (exclude noindex pages)

Definition of done

25–50 programmatic pages exist and render.

Some pages may be noindex until they pass quality.

Sitemap only includes indexable pages.

Phase 4 — Tools pages (SEO + future paid ads landing pages)
Goal

Add “tools” that convert and later become PPC landing pages. These also earn backlinks naturally.

Tasks

4.1) Add /tools/* routes (Astro pages) for 2 tools:

Stay/Go worksheet (client-side interactive, no auth required)

Severance/runway calculator (client-side interactive)

4.2) Instrument PostHog for:

tool_viewed

tool_completed (or meaningful milestones)

cta_clicked_from_tool

4.3) Add /lp/* landing pages intended for paid ads later:

These should be message-matched, minimal nav, high intent

Default to noindex until you’re ready

Definition of done

Tools exist and work without login.

PostHog captures tool usage events.

Landing pages exist but are not indexed by default.

Phase 5 — Optional: mount SPA under /app with minimal risk (no user migration yet)
Goal

Make a clean separation path available without disrupting existing users.

Tasks

5.1) Build a second SPA output that can run under /app:

Ensure Vite base path supports /app/

Ensure wouter routing supports the base

Ensure API calls remain same-origin (/api/...)

5.2) Update Express routing:

Serve SPA assets at /app/*

Keep existing SPA behavior at / untouched

5.3) Update the SEO site CTA links to point to /app instead of / (optional toggle)

Definition of done

/app loads the same product experience.

/ still works exactly as before.

Cookies/auth continue to function.

Phase 6 — Flip / to marketing for logged-out users (best end state)
Goal

Real homepage SEO without breaking returning users.

Tasks

6.1) Implement logic in Express:

If user is logged in, redirect / → /app

If logged out, serve marketing homepage HTML from SEO build

6.2) Create the marketing homepage in Astro:

Clear positioning

A single CTA (“Start session”)

Internal links to top pillars/tools

6.3) Ensure canonical + sitemap reflect the new homepage.

Definition of done

Logged-out users see marketing at /.

Logged-in users go straight to app at /app.

SEO can meaningfully rank the homepage now.

Phase 7 — Operational hardening + reuse for future products
Goal

Make this portable: “drop in taxonomy, get a marketing site.”

Tasks

7.1) Document “how to reuse” in /seo/README.md:

How to define taxonomy

How to add modules

How to generate pages

How to connect Express routing in a new product

7.2) Add a build pipeline in root package.json (or the repo’s build scripts) that:

builds app

builds seo

starts server

7.3) Add lightweight tests:

route smoke test for a handful of /guides/* and /tools/*

sitemap validation (at least “exists and includes expected URLs”)

Definition of done

One command builds everything.

A new product can reuse the SEO engine by swapping taxonomy and modules.

Notes for the Agent

Use /docs/seo_taxonomy_and_pillars.md as the primary source of truth for what to generate.

Keep the first programmatic batch intentionally small (25–50). Scale only after Search Console shows impressions and you’ve improved content modules.

Prefer conservative indexing (quality gate + noindex) over “ship 500 pages.”
