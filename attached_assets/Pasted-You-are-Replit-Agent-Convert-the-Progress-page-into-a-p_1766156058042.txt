You are Replit Agent. Convert the Progress page into a pure “table of contents” view that does not embed routing logic or perform auth checks. Make the smallest possible change.

Hard rules:

Only edit client/src/pages/progress.tsx.

Do not modify server code.

Do not change other pages.

Do not add new dependencies.

Do not add redirects to login; server gating and the AuthProvider handle access control.

Return: (1) diff-style summary, (2) full updated file, (3) a 6-step smoke test.

Target behavior for /app/progress:

The page must NOT call refetch() in useEffect() (remove any such calls).

The page must NOT navigate/redirect to /login or anywhere else based on auth state.

It should read cached bootstrap state from the auth context:

routing.resumePath (string)

journey.phase (string) and/or journey.state flags for display

Render:

A header like “Your progress”

A “Resume” button that navigates to routing.resumePath (use useNavigate() from react-router-dom and navigate(resumePath)).

A simple list of steps with completed/locked statuses derived ONLY from journey.state flags. Keep it basic; no complex logic.
Example steps: Interview, Purchase, Module 1, Module 2, Module 3, Coach Letter, Serious Plan.

If bootstrap has not loaded yet (authChecked is false), show a lightweight loading state (no redirect).

If authenticated but routing is missing for any reason, render a small error box that tells the user to refresh (do not redirect).

Important:

Keep styling minimal and consistent with existing UI components (Button/Card/etc. if already used in this file). Avoid design rabbit holes.

Do not remove existing helpful UI if it’s not harmful—just remove flow logic and refetch/redirect behavior.

Smoke test checklist must include:

/app/progress loads for paid user and shows Resume button

Clicking Resume goes to the server-defined next page

No extra network calls to /auth/me or repeated /api/bootstrap due to Progress mounting

/app/progress does not redirect to /login on its own

Refresh /app/progress works deterministically (server gate still in control)

Steps show reasonable completed/locked states based on flags
